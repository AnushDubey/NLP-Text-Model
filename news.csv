RM recalls wondering if he 'made right decision by joining' BTS: I was thinking about how I would be able to overcome...,"RM aka Kim Namjoon was the first member to join BTS. The group released their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool on June 12, 2013. Apart from RM, BTS also features Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. In an interview with Hypebeast, RM said, ""This is the most difficult question to answer truthfully. Recently, I watched Everything Everywhere All At Once. That film visualized many of the ideas that I’ve had, such as the idea about multiple versions of myself existing based on small choices I made. I often think about what it would have been like if I continued my studies or became something other than a musician."" ""To be honest, one decision that I had often thought about was my choice to become a part of a boy band. In the late 2000s, musicians like Zico, Changmo, and Giriboy were the people that I started out with. In my journey with BTS, I drifted further and further away from that world and was tormented by the thought that the people that I liked – and the people who enjoyed the same music as I – did not have any love for me. I often wondered whether I made the right decision by joining a boy band. At the time, BTS, was treated like a complete outsider in the Korean hip-hop community. That stressed me out. I was constantly thinking about how I would be able to overcome that perception and how to define music or hip-hop,” he added. RM released his first solo mixtape in 2015. Three years later, he released his second mixtape, Mono. RM has collaborated with artists such as Wale, Younha, Warren G, Gaeko, Krizz Kaliko, MFBTY, Fall Out Boy, Primary, Lil Nas X, Erykah Badu, and Anderson .Paak. Earlier this month, RM released his first full-length solo album Indigo.",2022-12-22T15:57:55Z,2,13

BLACKPINK: Angry fans of K-Pop group TWICE trend ‘Blinkscyberbullying’  – Here’s why,"K-Pop is synonymous with fan wars. BLACKPINK's Blinks and TWICE's Onces have been embroiled in a heated debate on social media ever since the Dahyun incident. It so happened that Kim Da-Hyun was doing a live with her fans when Lisa's music video, Lalisa came. As we know, it is one of the biggest K-Pop hits of 2021-22. The song is a bop and Lisa has picked up awards for the same. Da-hyun was playing songs of TWICE for fans when she skipped the music video of Lalisa that apparently came as an ad. This did not go down well with a certain section of Blackpink fandom. As per some Blinks, Da-hyun apparently lied that she did not have YT Premium account After that incident, tempers of TWICE and BLACKPINK fans rose on social media. As we know, verbal slurs on Twitter can be very derogatory and both fandoms slugged it out. Now, TWICE have written on Twitter that some Blinks cyber bullied and doxxed an admin of one of their biggest fan pages. Doxxing is leaking out someone's private information on social media with a malicious intent. This has apparently affected the health of the person who is now seeking treatment in a hospital.

J-Hope was seen asking Jungkook what he ate, to which the youngest member replied steak. J-Hope then tried to convince Jungkook to share another round of chipotle with him. He said, ""One more? Wanna share?"" As Jungkook said, ""Eh"" J-Hope said, ""Failed."" Then, J-Hope was seen pouring the spicy sauce into a chipotle dish as he made noises.

Odisha teen puts her heart and Seoul to place India on K-pop map,"BHUBANESWAR: Shreya Lenka, 18, from Odisha’s Jharsuguda wanted to be a dancer since her childhood. She participated in dance competitions and took lessons in Hindustani classical music to hone her skills. Lenka got a big break when she was selected for six-month training in Seoul to become a member of the Korean pop (K-Pop) band Blackswan. She has been in Seoul since December undergoing singing and dancing practice for hours under the trainers of music company DR Music Entertainment. Blackswan was started by the company as Rania in 2011. It later became BP Rania before getting its current name in October 2020. After its oldest member Hyeme left the group in November 2020, DR Music in May last year announced global auditions to replace her. Lenka, a Korean pop fan, applied for the online audition and was among the 23 shortlisted out of 4,000 applicants from across the world in July. The selections were made after their recorded videos were assessed by the DR Music. Four including Lenka were chosen for the final round for which they had to travel to Seoul for training for one of them would be chosen to replace Hyeme. Two of the four opted out leaving Lenka and Brazil’s Gabriela Dalcin as the final contestants. Lenka’s cousin, Sonali, said in the second round, she had to either dance or do a rap of the song Tonight from the Goodbye Rania album of the group in front of the camera. “She had to dance without any background music and do a rap on the song. A couple of weeks after we uploaded the unedited video of her performance on Google Drive, the company made an announcement on its YouTube channel about her selection,” said Sonali. She added Lenka had already given audition in several other Korean companies and they hoped she will make it. K-pop or Korean pop started out in South Korea in 1990s that included different musical genres such as rock, hip hop and electronic music. As the East Asian country experienced an economic boom in 90s bringing bigger purchasing power among the country’s youth, they gained easier access to American popular culture and artists. As per moonROK, a K-pop news portal, the foundation of K-pop was laid in 1992 with an electric hip-hop TV performance by Seo Taiji and Boys. Soon K-pop began spreading in non Asian countries like USA and some European countries. As per Koreaboo.com, the daily schedule of a K-pop trainee like Shreya is packed with classes that range from the standard vocal, rap, dance lessons to personal training, language, and musical instruments. Former K-pop idol Minu from the band Boyfriend in her Instagram post revealed that trainees go to the music company as early as 10 am and stay as late as midnight. Lenka’s father Avinash Lenka, who works in a private company in Jharsuguda, encouraged her to follow her passion for dancing. “From her childhood, she always wanted to be a dancer and participated in several dance competitions,” said her mother Priyatama. She added whether her daughter is finally chosen as the fifth member of Blackswan or not is another matter. “But she is focussed on learning Korean language and K-pop music.” Priyatama said her daughter was always focussed. “During school days, she used to head for dance training after reaching home at 2.30 pm and would not come back before 9 pm. I too wanted to pursue dancing but could not fulfil the dream as my father did not approve of it. I do not know if my daughter would become the first K-pop idol from India, but I am happy that she is living her dream.” In a statement, DR Music said Lenka and Dalcin were undergoing basic practice and Korean language education. “They will go through...six months of training. It is the final audition. We have prepared to prove through the training process that they themselves are eligible to debut as K-pop artists. Therefore, we will evaluate whether they have the basic skills to perform as a K-pop artist, such as their personality and qualities...” Sonali said her cousin’s schedule is hectic. By the time she returns to her room, she is completely exhausted. “We have formed a family WhatsApp group in which she sometimes chats. But the conversations are very brief.”",2022-02-04T08:00:00Z,2,9

He also said that he has asked the parliament to approve a relevant bill as early as possible. Hwang Hee said during a press briefing in Seoul on Wednesday, ""It's time to create a system for incorporating popular culture-art figures as art personnel. The system has been operated meaningfully to give those who have enhanced the national status based on their excellent skills more chances to contribute to the country, and there is no reason the popular art-culture field should be excluded from this."" Talking about the seven-member K-pop group BTS, which has fans all across the world, Hwang Hee said, ""I thought somebody should be a responsible voice at a time when there are conflicting pros and cons ahead of the enlistment of some of the BTS members."" He noted that forcing the BTS members to take a hiatus from their music career to serve in the military would cause a great loss to South Korea and the rest of the world. The members themselves have maintained that they will accept the military service whenever they are enlisted. However, their fans have repeatedly advocated for an exemption. ARMY welcomed the culture minister's latest statement, with one saying, ""They (BTS) don’t need it. They deserve it."" Another fan commented, ""Yes BTS contributed a lot to the economy of Korea, it's more than enough to serve their military service."" A third one wrote, ""In 2019 they brought in an 4.7 million dollars to SK. The percentage of GDP they bring into the country is on the same level as major brands such as Samsung and Hyundai. And that's not even touching the cultural impact they've made."" BTS had performed a four-day concert in the United States last month.

I just think I can show something a little more raw about me.

By doing so, I think maybe I can show something I never have before. Like, something that shows the things I usually think about a little more honestly?"" He further said, ""My thoughts are already well-represented on BTS’ albums, but, you know, some of the older members have already dealt with some darker material on their solo mixtapes. I think I’m trying to do something similar. I’m doing this more for my own sake than because I want to say something to other people. Because after a year and a half of the pandemic, I was thinking a lot about how I was a little lost. Once the other members found out about that, they said, 'Why don’t you try to make it into music?'

"BTS: When Rookie Bangtan Boys – Kim Taehyung, Jimin, J-Hope and others showcased their OTT ramp walk but only to make ARMY LOL","BTS members - RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook - also known as the Bangtan Boys have been ruling the hearts since 2013, their debut showcase. And those who got to know about the Bangtannies now and are yet to explore their initial days are in for a treat. BTS members have been helluva goofy ever since they started training. And today, we are here with a throwback video of BTS members from the Dark & Wild era. Once, the Bangtan Boys dropped a video on Bangtan TV wherein they turned a corridor into their ramp and flaunted their OTT ramp walk A year after their debut, the BTS members - RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook - switched on their crazy side and decided to pretend to walk the ramp. It was late in the night, and the boys were in for some mischief and some fun it seems. They turned a corridor of their room into a ramp and pretended to be models and showcased their 'walks'. Of course, each of them went OTT and it's only going to leave the ARMY, laughing out loud The Bangtan Bomb video begins with Suga aka Min Yoongi. He oozes swag in his walk but it's certainly OTT. The posture he strikes before walking back will make you think whether he really is the calm and cool Yoongi. Up next is Jimin aka Park Jimin. He is like a bratty kid left loose in the park who tries to be a bully but backs off because, Jimin's kiddo, after all After Jimin, it's Jungkook aka the Golden Maknae's turn. It seems someone pushed Jungkook on the ramp forcefully. And now, he has to make it look cool. Jungkook looked like the kid who would brag but it's all just false pretence.  Towards the end, JK strikes the spiderman-style pose and it's hilarious. Next, we have is J-Hope aka Jung Hoseok. He's got the style in his walk but later goofs it up with his real personality. J-Hope is the funniest in this one. The fourth member to walk the corridor ramp is V aka Kim Taehyung. And y'all would know how much Taetae loves being extra! His dance before walking back would make you think if he's possessed or something. However, V ends it pretty smoothly It's RM's turn to walk the ramp. But instead of walking, he's just jumping around like an overexcited kid in the whole lot who later gets conscious and calms the hell down. Next comes the conjuring X star Jin, walking with the up in the bow pose, in the scariest manner. He falls down and but gets up only to walk in the most threatening manner as though challenging people to laugh. Lastly, they all walk the ramp, we mean, the corridor together. Taehyung, J-Hope, Jimin and Jungkook are still being extra while Jin turns into a cool kid. Suga seems to be trying to kick off the pain of his joints while RM's still conscious of his ramp walk. Watch the goofy and funny throwback BTS video here: It's been nine years since BTS' debut. And though they have considerably matured and evolved as people, they still are childish somewhere. Run BTS has been the proof of the same. ARMY, you'd be glad to have Run BTS back, no?",2022-08-25T07:00:00Z,1,1

BTS faces possible military conscription as South Korean official says it's 'desirable' for group to fulfil duties,"Under South Korean law, all able-bodied men are required to perform 18-21 months of military service. But the law provides special exemptions for athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers who have won top prizes in certain competitions that enhance national prestige. Recently, news agency AP, reported that commissioner of the Military Manpower Administration Lee Ki Sik told lawmakers on Friday that it’s “desirable” for BTS members to fulfil their military duties to ensure fairness in the country’s military service. Earlier this week, Defence Minister Lee Jong-sup made almost identical comments about BTS at a parliamentary committee meeting, and Culture Minister Park Bo Gyoon said his ministry would soon finalize its position on the issue. Several amendments of the conscription law that would pave the way for BTS members to be exempted have been introduced in the National Assembly, but haven't been voted on with lawmakers sharply divided on the matter. Without a revision of the law, the government can take steps to grant special exemptions. But past exemptions for people who performed well in non-designated competitions triggered a serious debate about the fairness of the system. Since the draft forces young men to suspend their professional careers or studies, the dodging of military duties or creation of exemptions is a highly sensitive issue. The public too remains sharply divided over whether BTS should be given exemptions. In a recent survey, about 61% of respondents supported exemptions for entertainers such as BTS, while in another, about 54% said BTS members should serve in the military. In August, Lee Jong-sup had said if BTS members join the military, they would likely be allowed to continue practising and to join other non-serving BTS members in overseas group tours. People who are exempted from the draft are released from the military after three weeks of basic training. They are also required to perform 544 hours of volunteer work and continue serving in their professional fields for 34 months.",2022-10-08T07:00:00Z,2,15

As translated by Twitter user @BTStranslation_, he said, ""When I think about you guys (ARMYs) these emotions fill me up and overwhelm me so much that I sometimes think about ‘what would I do if all of this disappears, if this is all a dream’ I thought about things like that. Therefore I came to write a song on that basis and I wondered if the song's vibes might become too sad/depressing so I filled up the song lyrics with pretty words.""

Speaking on Intersections Season 2 podcast, RM said, “This is my first time actually saying this but seriously, I am planning to make a small space of my own private collection and then just make a cafe on the first floor and set up my collections on the second floor and third floor. People could always see the collections when they just want to see them. Because when people come to Korea, and it happens for the Koreans too, we can’t see the great Korean artists because there aren’t many museums right now. There are not many galleries right now. I just want to make my own some time."" RM also spoke about being a part of BTS and their sacrifices, ""Being a team member it does mean that we have to sacrifice our own soul or own personality, we have to cut it out because there are seven personalities and we were 19 or 18 when we started as a team but now we’re almost 30. We became men and adults so we have different characters or maybe different future visions. But BTS is still really important for me, it’s the biggest part of me. But keeping this intensity as a team made me easy to forget who I was & why I started this thing. I just want to remind and reminisce myself as to why I started this, what can I do with my own thing. So for my 30s, I just want to figure out the way to exist like half for BTS member and leader RM and maybe just Namjoon Kim as himself."" RM spoke about himself and BTS days after the group, comprising him, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin and Jungkook released their anthology album Proof. The new album consists of several new and old songs.

It's been 10 months since the last Run BTS episode dropped on Weverse. The new Run BTS episode is called Telepathy. And it's so much fun to see the boys get together and play the game again, just like the good old days. Along with the Run BTS episode, back were Bangtan Boys aka RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Kim Taehyung and Jungkook's goofy personalities. Let's check out the most heartwarming moment of Run BTS' latest episode In the latest episode of Run BTS, we saw the Bangtannies playing the Telepathy game. In the first game, they had to guess letters each based on questions. The telepathy of the Bangtan Boys - RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook - kinda failed for various reasons. TBH, we have to give it to the Run BTS producers/ directors who increased the difficulty level of Run BTS with such a game. The second was the game of guessing the gestures and it had to be Telepathically matched with the other members. Suga, Hobi and RM goofed up a couple of times. It was fun to see their expressive side back again.

They were given clues in terms of words and were asked to guess the destination and reach there. The clues for the first round were 'Real Fun'. Jimin, Taehyung, Jin and RM felt their old dorm was the place they had the most fun. Suga went to the Han River whereas J-Hope reached Jamsil Stadium where they had practised the most. Jungkook, on the other hand, had at first thought about the dorm too. But he later switched the destination to the far away place of Lotte World. The reunion of Jin, Taehyung, Jimin and RM through telepathy was indeed a heartwarming moment At the end of the Run BTS episode, we saw RM, Jimin and Taehyung discussing having thoughts of Lotte World too but had opted out due to the distance. Now, in the next episode of Run BTS, we will see three more rounds of destination telepathy being played. The clues for the second round are Salty or Mad. What could be the destination, ARMY, any guesses?",2022-08-16T07:00:00Z,1,13

The surgery was short and he's okay honestly."" The live saw Jin's representative, BT21 character RJ's soft toy. Referring to it, Jungkook said, ""That's why this friend came (RJ).

Next, their conversation steered towards their Instagram accounts. Suga asked J-Hope if he has deleted all his Instagram photos. J-Hope replied, ""No. I moved a couple over to archive. I didn't delete it. I moved them to the archive. Turns out you can bring them back later. I searched about it."" Jimin also spoke on why he doesn't share posts on Instagram regularly. He said, ""With Instagram, I can’t go on it because I’m scared I might press something wrong."" As RM urged him to share posts he said he will.

"BTS: V speaks on new ability he wants to achieve in 2022, Suga reveals question that provokes him the most","BTS members have spoken about a host of topics concerning them in the past year and also this new year. In an interview, the group members spoke about an ability they would want to acquire this year, a question that provokes them, an alternate profession, among other questions. In a video shared by Vogue Korea on YouTube, Jimin was asked about the words that impressed him the most in 2021. Replying to this, he said, “I remember the words, 'It's how it is'. Since the pandemic continues, lots of people are suffering and each person has different hardships and situations. I also went through some difficult times. I wanted to perform and met our fans too. So there was a time when I felt isolated. As time passed, I began to empathize with and felt the pain of the words, 'It's how it is'.” In the special edition interview, Jungkook was asked about the words that he wants to hear the most in 2022. He responded, ""Since there's no one who doesn't like compliments. I guess 'cool' would be the best. 'Cool' could be interpreted in various ways. It could mean the personality's cool or the performance on the stage is cool or the voice is cool. It can explain a lot of things, so I like the words, 'So cool'. So in 2022, I hope to hear such a word."" BTS' V was asked if he could obtain a new ability this year, what would he choose. He replied, “Besides music and dance, I want to get the ability to play the instruments well. When it comes to instruments, one has to invest lots of time into the songs they want to play and in the end, they can feel a huge sense of accomplishment. But, I don't know how to play instruments. I used to play the saxophone often back then, but I found out that it was too hard to play all the songs I love with just saxophone. So, whether it's trumpet, clarinet or violin, I'd like to play all the songs I like, so I assume I'd choose instruments.” Next, J-Hope was asked what is the thing he has always been better at than others. He said, ""When I meet people, I think I'm good at absorbing them. Whoever I meet, I tend to try to go along with them, and I kind of absorb things like a sponge. That would be what I'd call 'a thing I'm better at than others'."" Jin was asked what profession would he want to choose, if not his current one. He answered, ""If I were to do something else as a profession, even though I don't sell stuff, I like to recommend things I got to friends around me. I haven't recommended anything to my members, but I think I'd like to work as a person who persuades that 'This is way better', so buy this one instead. A job of persuading that a certain product is better than others."" Suga was asked that if he were asked a question that provokes him the most, what would it be. ""A question that provokes me? 'What can you accomplish if you're so lazy like that? What would you do with such laziness?' I think this kind of question quite provokes me. I do tend to try hard to live diligently and busily, but I'm still not satisfied, so I split my time even more. I hope to become a more diligent person, so those questions would provoke me."" Lastly, BTS leader RM was asked if he was mentioned in the textbook 50 years later, what sentence he would like there. He said, ""If I'm to be included just 'There was this kind of person among K-pop idols'. I hope to be written as one of those 'examples'. A very unique person who loved music, worked hard and challenged on things. Just like that, I guess? If I were to be in the textbook, I think I should be an outliner."" He concluded by saying, ""We're already in the textbook, so it's fine."" Last year, BTS members had travelled to the US for four Los Angeles in-person concerts. They returned to South Korea in December. After that, BTS announced that they will be taking an 'extended period of rest', their first since 2019.",2022-01-03T08:00:00Z,2,11

I kept changing the track list because of that and couldn't finish it. It never fit perfectly. I was always like 'No this isn't it, I don't want to use this one'. It kept getting put off... I realised the album doesn't need to be one genre, I decided to branch out and try new genres I've always wanted to try. So I'm working on a lot of songs right now."" He also said, ""I had meetings with some of the directors who will shoot the video. But this is the problem, there's only a demo version of the song. I've to start the actual recording but I keep feeling like something's missing, so was like 'later, later'. I can't present this kind of music to ARMY.""

"BTS' RM thinks he 'hit a kind of wall', says he needs to create music 'that’s more timeless'","Recalling his earlier mixtape, RM said that in 2015 he 'called out the rapper side of me I wanted to show off'. In 2018, he 'brought up my personal idols' to express his 'darker, gloomy side that I had been wanting to show'. He added that in 2022, he's hopeful and thinking that 'it might just be enough to convey something while being purely my sincere self'. In an interview with Weverse magazine, RM said, “I think I need to try taking a step away from myself for a minute. I think that way I’ll know what the work I’m doing right now means to me and what it is to me. So now I’m worried if I’m just doing the things I’m given and if I’m losing myself in a way. It was never my intention to live feeling this way, and I want to live an independent and active life, but now I’m starting to wonder if I’m living too passively because of the pandemic, and it’s unbearable. That includes how I felt at the Grammys, and I think I’ve hit a kind of wall. It’s something I felt when I looked at artists like Lady Gaga or H.E.R. who devote their entire lives to their music: We need a message so we can be sure and assert our own image, too.” He said that the Butter performance at the Grammy Awards astonished people and was unique. RM added that it’s time for BTS ‘to move beyond astonishing people and think again about what kind of messages we can send people now'. He also said, ""I think I should be making things that will shine even after time passes. I think I need to approach something that’s more timeless...If I just work without being aware of that, then I have a feeling that, with the way everything’s swept away so quickly now by everything coming out in that time under the fast-changing algorithm, the things I make might look outdated later. It really feels like everything is thrown out after just a few years with how fast the world changes, so it makes me think I want to attain some kind of everlastingness."" Recently, BTS released their anthology album Proof, comprising new as well as old tracks. A few days later, the group said they would take a break, during Festa dinner. HYBE, however, has clarified that BTS is not taking any hiatus.",2022-06-19T07:00:00Z,2,13

BTS: South Korea to conduct public survey over group's military service?,"The issue of military service for the seven members of the group has been a topic of discussion in the country as BTS' oldest member, Jin, faces enlistment in December when he turns 30. BTS' Jin was born in 1992, Suga in 1993, RM and J-Hope in 1994, Jimin and V in 1995 and Jungkook in 1997. The country has been debating shortening mandatory military service for K-pop stars to three weeks from about two years. As per news agency AP, Jong-sup's comments created a stir following which his ministry clarified in a statement that he ordered officials to examine whether such a survey is needed, instead of launching it immediately. According to the statement, officials were asked to check details including which agency would be responsible for a survey, who exactly would be surveyed and how long would it take. The statement also added that if the survey is carried out, it will not be done by the ministry or related authorities, to ensure fairness. The survey will be done by a third organization. As per AP, the ministry said the results would be only one of the many factors determining BTS members' military status. According to South Korean law, all able-bodied men must serve 18-21 months in the military under a conscription system established to deal with threats from North Korea. However, the country gives exemption to athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers who win top places in certain competitions because they are considered to have enhanced national prestige. Those exempted are released from the military after taking three weeks of basic training. But they are required to perform 544 hours of volunteer work and serve in their respective professional fields for 34 months. Some politicians have called for expanding the scope of exemptions to include K-pop stars such as BTS as they have elevated the country's international image significantly. with AP inputs",2022-09-01T07:00:00Z,2,13

BTS: South Korean lawmaker says reason behind group's break was 'Jin's military service',"BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook during their Festa dinner in June spoke about why they wanted a break. RM had said while he enjoyed being in BTS, the group members now feel ""exhausted"" and he doesn't ""know what kind of group we were any more"". Jimin admitted that the group has been going through a ""rough patch"" as it is trying to ""find our identity, and that’s an exhausting and long process"". Now speaking to Reuters, Sang-hyun said that BTS took the break as the 'main reason' of 'waiting for parliament to decide has been hugely stressful' for them. ""The members cited exhaustion and the need for rest as the main reason but the real reason was Jin's military service,"" said Sang-hyun. He added that BTS raised the country's profile worldwide through ""soft power"" and it should be taken into account when considering their military service. ""BTS has done a job that would take more than 1,000 diplomats to do,"" said the lawmaker. South Korea's military service requires all able-bodied men aged between 18 and 28 to serve for about two years. Over the years, particular categories of men have won exemptions--either allowed to put off service for a certain time or allowed to do shorter service--including men who win a medal at the Olympics or Asian Games and classical musicians and dancers who win a top prize at certain competitions. Under a 2019 revision of the law in the country, globally recognised K-pop stars were allowed to put off their service until the age of 30. BTS management company, BigHit Music, has maintained that the group members are keen to do their duty. In April, BigHit official Lee Jin-hyung told a news conference in Las Vegas that some band members were having a ""hard time"" because of ""uncertainties"" over the parliament debate. He called for a decision. When Jin was later asked about Jin-hyung's comments, he said he was letting the company handle the matter. He added that what the official said reflected his view.",2022-07-04T07:00:00Z,2,13

A fan asked Jin to give them makgeolli (Korean alcoholic beverage) as they can drink it in four years. He said, ""They say if you don’t make a brand, it’s illegal to give alcohol. That’s why I couldn’t give it to the members either. I have to invite you to my house to drink it."" ""Not to be dramatic but I'm going to die from a broken heart,"" said an ARMY. ""Oh no.

Run BTS! 2023 Special Episode Next Top Genius Teaser OUT: Full Run BTS Special Episodes List,"&lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; is BTS&rsquo; fame variety show which used to be a weekly catch-up between the group and their fans as the septet tried on different activities to entertain the fans. It seems as though BTS will be bringing in their 2023 with a loud cheer as ahead of new year&#39;s day, they announced another special episode of the program with all seven members starring in it. The BTS ARMY is particularly celebrating the presence of member Jin who is now serving in the military, becoming the first from the group to do so.

Run BTS! 2023 Special Episode Next Top Genius&nbsp;

The upcoming episode has been named, &lsquo;Run BTS! 2023 Special Episode Next Top Genius&rsquo;, and the teaser introduced the chaos that will unfold a week later. The seven members gathered in front of a table setting, ready to play a game of cards. It is likely that more than one game will be played in this episode, which will see the BTS members put their mind to test. With everyone bluffing, it is only natural that they are after the real liar. In another game, it seems as though brain movement/thought-sensitive headbands were placed on their heads with cat ears adding to their adorableness. X and O paddle in their hands, and they test out each other. A shocking revelation seems to await the fans at the end of the upcoming &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; special episode.
NrfFsgWSpQUWhile &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; took a break in October last year, it returned a few months ago in August much to the delight of the BTS ARMY. It returned with another change, however, which was the theme song that is regularly updated, now becoming &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo;, the group&rsquo;s hit track from their latest full group release, &lsquo;Proof&rsquo;. Here&rsquo;s a full list of all the &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; special episodes you can tune in to so far.

Run BTS! 2022 Special Episode - Telepathy

Assessing the truth behind BTS&rsquo; &lsquo;one body one soul&rsquo; mindset, their knowledge about each other was tested in this episode, While it began lightly with quick questions on their friendship and traits it soon turned into a bigger surprise as the members were &lsquo;kidnapped&rsquo;. With seven cars, each carrying one of them to different locations, they were handed keywords that would steer them towards certain spots engraved in their memory. The game ends once all of them are at the same spot. The whole of Seoul at their disposal, once again their telepathy skills were questioned. Meeting and separating, laughing and reminiscing, do they finally all end up at the same location?

Run BTS! 2022 Special Episode - Fly BTS Fly

Putting member Jungkook&rsquo;s idea into action, one that he mentioned offhandedly as the others were also throwing random thoughts for upcoming &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; episodes, the South Korean superstars headed to try their hand, or should we say mind and boy, at flying yoga. Usually, an activity demonstrated by a female trainer, a skilled young man who was at the receiving end of BTS&rsquo; admiration, trained them at difficult moves. Their one aim? To take Instagrammable photos. And so the grunts and cries for help ensued as the flexible ones like Jimin and Jungkook put their best foot forward while the rest struggled to stay in position. It created hilarious content full of laughter and words of praise from the members for each other as well as for the trainer who was previously seen teaching TOMORROW X TOGETHER. Some BTS members also shared the photos they worked so hard for on Instagram later on.

Run BTS! 2022 Special Episode - &lsquo;RUN BTS&rsquo; TV On-air

The latest edition of &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; saw the members each take on their own live broadcasts with the other members as their audience. Jungkook started off by learning some drumming while SUGA painted according to the viewers&rsquo; suggestions. Jin became his famous video gamer self as he stopped himself from exerting extreme anger at the games he played and J-Hope found the perfect hobby for himself as a children&rsquo;s toy broadcaster. V showed off his fabulous golf skills and RM put his wittiness to the test. In the end, Jimin got to eat some unique food items very deliciously as an ASMR broadcaster. Funnily enough, BTS turned on their &lsquo;mean&rsquo; sides while continuously commenting and asking for appropriate interaction during the said lives, earning hilarious responses from those on camera.&nbsp;

Run BTS re-release

Recently, it was announced that the program &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; which used to be exclusive to VLive at first along with Weverse later, would be made available on YouTube. While the Special Episodes of &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; were also simultaneously released on the video giant, the earlier editions which dated back to 2015 when the show first began will also be re-released in a span of 3 days as a Christmas gift to the BTS ARMY. This could be a result of HYBE acquiring VLive through its subsidiary Weverse Company.

"RUN BTS TV On-air Part 2 Review: J-Hope, V, RM and Jimin have the best time entertaining the rest","Run BTS returned with a new episode of &#39;RUN BTS TV On-air&#39; this week and once again left the fans in splits  With members Jungkook, SUGA and Jin taking over the jobs of a live drummer, painter and gaming broadcaster in the last week, the rest of the squad was in action this time 

J-Hope

Being his hope-filled and vibrant self, the BTS member got to business by introducing the various toys at his disposal  J-Hope himself was more surprised at the different types of items available in the market  A peculiar flamingo who would repeat his words caught the attention of the BTS members and they began making fun of it 

V

Kim Taehyung is known to be a fan of golf and is regularly seen practising alongside his friends, members and even pro-golfers  He visits well-known locations to try his hand at the sport and is known to have gotten quite a good game over time  This time, an arcade version of golf with him, V tried out a live broadcast boasting his skills  With a comical expression on his face and multiple gold clubs with different angles and types, he began challenging new levels  His willful ignorance of the other BTS members&rsquo; comments was funny to them as well as to the viewers 

RM
Leader RM used his skills in a game of world cup where he chose one of the cutest animals with the help of the other BTS members  He would get two options and would go with the more popular one among the members as well as the one his heart wished for on occasions when there is a tie  In the end, it was a baby fox who was chosen as the winner  In another similar world cup, the battle between two very random options struck it out as the group chose their pick 

Jimin
The last member to display his unique skills was Jimin who began a food broadcast, also known as mukbang  He grabbed some yummy-looking pizza and the others revelled in the delicious food on his table  They asked him to mix various sauces and dip the fried chicken in them  The funniest part of the episode came when Jin grabbed Jimin&rsquo;s device and began commenting hilariously  A jelly-fried egg later, it was sure that this would be a treat not just for the eyes but for the ears as the BTS member put in an ASMR twist to it, earning shrieks of disgust in return  They all replied with funny-looking photos expressing their fake anger 

&lsquo;RUN BTS TV On-air&rsquo; has ended, however, there has been more than one reason to note how multi-talented the BTS members are

I’m INFJ he’s ENFJ so the same but different, HA!), RM being the lovable goof and good leader he is, Jin being funny and handsome and sweet, V who is suave and like a puppy at the same time and JK who is good at everything  I studied music for a while before like [*life] had other plans  I can’t help but wonder if I had continued that maybe we would have met through those channels  You’re everything I wanted to be and everything I want in a person  I hope one day I find someone in real life that is as great as you are  I can’t tell my whole life story, but just know we’re a lot alike and I am forever grateful for everything you and BTS have done for me from thousands of miles away  Maybe one day I’ll get to meet the lot of you and give the biggest hugs and in-person thank-yous I know you are [not] perfect people but you come close enough to me and I only dream of finding a forever person who makes me feel the way Bangtan does; especially you  사랑해, Virginia SchleichDisclaimer: If you need support or know someone who is struggling with anxiety or depression, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist or speak to someone about it  There are several helplines available for the same ALSO READ: Dear BTS: A fan from the US hopes to attend a BTS concert soonWant to let out in words, your undying fondness for your favourite K-drama and K-pop stars?Email your open letter to: editorial@pinkvilla com, mentioning your full name, country, IG handle and Twitter handle  The opportunity is open to readers from across the globe  Your letters may also feature on our official Instagram page Hallyutalk as well so don't forget to follow us there! Disclaimer: This is user-generated content  The views and opinions expressed in this letter are those of the author Join the biggest community of K-Pop fans live on Pinkvilla Rooms to get one step closer to your favourite K-Celebs!

"BTS: J-Hope talks about Jin calling from military on New Year’s Eve, BIGBANG’s Taeyang confirms Jimin collab?","2022 came to a celebratory end for BTS, especially member J-Hope, who was in New York, making another fabulous display of his skills  While away from the members, he seemed to have enjoyed it to the fullest with a solo performance at Dick Clark&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s Rockin&rsquo; Eve where he did a live stage of 3 songs, solo track &lsquo;= (Equal Sign)&rsquo;, &lsquo;Chicken Noodle Soup&rsquo; his collaboration track with Becky G, and BTS&rsquo; &lsquo;Butter&rsquo; (Holiday Remix)  He officially became only the second South Korean soloist to perform at the event, following PSY  This was also J-Hope&rsquo;s third time at Dick Clark&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s Rockin&rsquo; Eve after group stages with BTS in 2017 and 2019 

J-Hope&rsquo;s live

After returning from Times Square where he performed as the penultimate act alongside multiple other singers from around the world and spoke to Ryan Seacrest, the host of the show, J-Hope was back at his hotel room and turned on a live broadcast to speak with his fans  As they congratulated him on his sparkling performance, being the perfectionist that he is, J-Hope expressed his sadness about being unable to use his voice to the fullest and talked about the slipping incident due to the rainy weather during his rehearsal stage &nbsp;

J-Hope on other BTS members&rsquo; New Year wishes

As soon as it turned 12, and the New Year began in South Korea, BTS members Jungkook, Jimin, and V took to the fan community platform Weverse to share their wishes with the fans as well as discuss their plans for the coming year  Jungkook and V kept it brief, wishing for a successful and happy year ahead while Jimin wrote a big letter to his fans about the feelings he had seemingly bottled for a long time about his wishes to release new music soon for which he has been meeting up with composers 

Thousands of miles away, member J-Hope was his cheeky self as he unleashed all his love for his fellow BTS members  He began commenting &lsquo;love you&rsquo; on their posts with cute words and received laughs from them in return 

Jin&rsquo;s call to J-Hope

On being asked about BTS&rsquo; oldest member Jin who became the first from the group to enlist in the military on December 13, J-Hope recalled how he was called by the member with a different phone number and almost missed it  J-Hope said, &ldquo;Right before I was about to sleep on the 31st, I got a call from Jin and asked him how he was doing to which he said J-Hope, pick up your phone  I told him I did not know this number, how would I know it was his?&rdquo;

The &lsquo;Arson&rsquo; hitmaker spoke with a smile on his face about how he felt happy hearing Jin&rsquo;s voice  It comforted him and J-Hope mentioned how he remembered all those moments he spent with Jin  He assured the fans by saying that Jin seemed to be healthy and doing well in the military  So in place of Jin, he shared that he was well and asked the fans to not worry  The lovely duo, BTS&rsquo; Jin and J-Hope nicknamed 2seok have always&nbsp;lightened the fans&rsquo; hearts with this interaction 
https://twitter com/nightstar1201/status/1609428759454822401Jimin X Taeyang

BTS member Jimin and BIGBANG member Taeyang are a collaboration nobody would have expected  However, in December 2022, it was reported by industry officials that the two are working together on a release that will soon be revealed to the world  To this, Taeyang&rsquo;s then-agency, YG Entertainment, which he has since departed, replied by saying that they cannot confirm anything at the moment and asked fans to anticipate Taeyang&rsquo;s activities &nbsp;

On January 1, Taeyang who is currently a free agent, not having signed with anyone for his solo activities as he continues to be with YG Entertainment for any content related to BIGBANG, shared a rare update on his Instagram account  2 photos were shared with a caption of the hashtag #2023  In black and white, 2 people could be seen in the photos, their backs to the camera  While one could easily be spotted as Taeyang himself, the other one was not tagged &nbsp;

                                                                                    
                                                                                Fans went into action and soon began investigating every detail of the photo  The other person seemed to be Jimin, as his hands, fluffy hair, and earrings seem to match the BTS member  Though no official announcement was made from either side, it seems that the singers have decided to give a green signal from their ends  Taeyang is rumoured to have been preparing for a January 2023 comeback so it seems as though we can expect the reports any time now  Once confirmed, this could very well be the biggest release of the year and one of the most hyped collaborations in K-pop history!

Meanwhile, BIGBANG&rsquo;s G-Dragon also announced that he is working on an album and hopes to release it in 2023

OMG: 5 reasons why NewJeans’ latest release is one of the best K-Pop MVs till date,"On January 2nd at 6 PM KST (2:30 PM IST), NewJeans&#39; single album and MV &#39;OMG&#39; was released  &#39;OMG&#39; deals with the story of a strange sense of distance, caution, and unfamiliarity that coexist on the side of the desire to get closer to each other  s a bouncy and exciting hip-hop R&amp;B song that mixes &#39;UK garage&#39; rhythm and trap rhythm based on hip-hop drum source and percussion 

OMG:

This song expresses NewJeans&#39; unique and trendy tone in various styles, and it is expected that you will be able to feel another personality and charm of NewJeans  It is also expected to present a completely different feeling from the debut album &#39;NewJeans&#39; released last summer  NewJeans is one of the representative 4th generation girl groups that made the second half of 2022 hot with their debut  In a short period of time, not only did all of the triple title songs such as &#39;Attention&#39;, &#39;Cookie&#39; and &#39;Hype Boy&#39; become hits, but also led to the cover dance craze, winning both the Rookie Award and the Grand Prize at the year-end awards ceremony  He boasted an unrivaled presence and charm 

NewJeans&#39; achievement:

In particular, it showed the &#39;retro&#39; concept properly  With styling and cover images reminiscent of the 1990s and early 2000s, they instantly caught the eye, establishing themselves as a girl group with a unique concept  Here, while focusing on the narrative of &#39;relationship&#39;, the music video with an interesting story received a lot of attention  The chorus that is easy to sing along with the lyrics that resonate with, the addictive melody, and the attractive choreography were also points  As a result, content such as challenges, cover songs, and cover dances naturally increased &nbsp;

Ditto:

The pre-released song &#39;Ditto&#39; attracted attention as soon as it was released with Park Ji Hu and Choi Hyun Wook&#39;s appearances and the retro sensibility of the video  In this way, New Jeans has already captured not only the topic but also the music charts in a short period of time  If last summer was refreshing NewJeans, this hip-hop R&amp;B &#39;OMG&#39; is expected to show a hip yet dreamy NewJeans 

NewJeans:

The strengths of NewJeans, such as the retro concept to believe in and watch, the narrative music video that is tightly packed with the keyword &#39;relationship&#39;, the content that makes you more immersed, the beautiful visuals of the members, the ability to blend these concepts perfectly, and the addictive yet attractive song  The number of pre-orders for NewJeans&#39; &#39;OMG&#39; this time exceeded 800,000 copies, surpassing the pre-order amount of the debut album and the total sales volume  The pre-released song &#39;Ditto&#39; took first place on various music charts upon its release, and is still receiving a lot of love 
_ZAgIHmHLdcHere are five reasons why this song and MV had us gripping our seats:-&nbsp;

Song

The title song &#39;OMG&#39;, which was released following the pre-release song released at the end of the year, is a bouncy and exciting hip-hop R&amp;B song that mixes UK garage rhythm and trap rhythm based on hip-hop drum source and percussion  In particular, the fact that the song was conceived during the production of the debut album also arouses interest  Member Hanni participated in writing the lyrics, and one can feel another charm of NewJeans by expressing their unique and trendy tone in various styles 

Concept&nbsp;

NewJeans have made a name for themselves from their debut time as one of the most unique K-Pop groups to exist as they break the stereotypes and the mold presented to them by the predecessors and rather, pave a new way of creating music as well as the MV  The MV is set in a mental facility where the five members express their issues and who they see themselves as  While it can seem quirky and funny, it is actually an inside view on how intense feelings can alter you as a person &nbsp;

The members&nbsp;

In the MV, each member has a different problem  Hanni thinks she is Siri, iPhone&rsquo;s built-in, voice controlled personal assistant, Danielle was found laughing at a TV with static but she is actually the person who thinks they are being controlled and tries to make the members remember that they are, in fact, NewJeans  It seems like Hyein has &lsquo;main character syndrome&rsquo; where she takes the role of the main character in her favorite fairy tales like Cinderella, Matchstick girl and Snow White while Haerin thinks she is a cat and is seen in many scenes, behaving like one  But the most twisted one is Minji&rsquo;s, who pretends to be a doctor taking all the other members to the facility while she, herself, suffers through issues &nbsp;

The message&nbsp;

The song talks about being lovesick and how those intense feelings make one go crazy and that is what shows in the MV as well  The idea of being meta in the MV also adds a nice flair to it  The idea of being in a relationship and expressing the struggles of being in one in this day and age is amazingly executed &nbsp;

References&nbsp;

The MV is packed with references  First, the choreography for OMG was initially shown to the viewers in Ditto and other scenes from that MV also makes its way like the gray cat represents Haerin  Kim Joo Hun of Big Mouth fame makes an appearance as the doctor who eventually becomes overwhelmed with all the stories he heard but the end scene is truly the cherry on top when a girl is shown writing hate comments about NewJeans and Minji appears as the doctor, taking her away &nbsp;

Veautiful Days: BTS’ V looks regal in the first set of preview photos for Photo-Folio,"BTS&rsquo; V will release a personal pictorial &#39;Beautiful Days&#39; on December 23rd, Big Hit Music announced on the 8th  This pictorial is the latest work of &#39;Special 8 Photo-Folio&#39;, a pictorial project where BTS members express their individuality Following Jungkook, RM, Jimin, and Jin, this is the fifth work as an individual pictorial 

Preview Photos:

In the preview image released on the day, V played a gentleman riding a horse or enjoying tea time against the backdrop of 19th century Europe  V directly participated in the overall pictorial work from the planning stage to express his own color  On December 8th, Mood Sampler #1 and #2 of V&#39;s pictorial project special 8 photo-folio &#39;Me, Myself, and V &#39;Veautiful Days&#39; were released on BTS&#39; official YouTube channel  In the released video, V caught the eye with a romantic and classic look  His fans praised her with comments such as &ldquo;He always delivers,&rdquo; &ldquo;He seems to have come out of a fairy tale or a movie,&rdquo; &ldquo;Each concept is art,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beautiful Taehyung &rdquo;

Mood Sampler 1:

In particular, this video was directed by V as a film director and perfectly reflected V&#39;s intention that &quot;I think classics are destined to come back to classics again &quot; &#39;Mood Sampler #1&#39; was held in the background of a garden with trumpets and birdsong and a window with sunlight shining through  When we saw V with neat and deep eyes through the leaves, the true beauty &#39;Veautiful&#39; unfolded  V&#39;s profile as he gazes at the leaves is a perfect beauty like a statue made by a sculptor with all his might, and his eyes contain a sense of nostalgia  It took his breath away when he saw V&#39;s delicate and graceful side profile while hearing only the sound of birdsong and turning the pages, as calm and slow as a slowly swinging antique pocket watch 

Dressed in a blue suit and white ribbon, V appeared in a classic, trendy, and unrealistic look at the same time  &quot;He proved what he said  The scene where V looks at the camera with a languid and dreamy gaze with his hands on his face under the sunlight at the window reminds me of an aristocratic young man in a classic British movie and completes all the fantasies of those who dream of romance 

Mood Sampler 2:

When &#39;Mood Sampler #2&#39; started, a romantic video of wild flowers placed on a white bedclothes came out  The appearance of V running with a flower in his mouth while looking up at the sky gave viewers a dazzling and colorful charm that goes back and forth between defenseless boyishness and bewitching beauty, making viewers fall in love

"RUN BTS TV On-air Part 1 Review: Jungkook, SUGA and Jin are comical broadcasters","Run BTS has been a place of comfort and respite to the fans of BTS who look forward to the group&rsquo;s goofy and human-like sides as they take a break from their usual superstar activities to play around  While a regular edition of the show has ended, the group often returns between their busy schedules and headline-making promotions to be their usual selves in special episodes aired every now and then 

RUN BTS TV On-air
A preview of the new episode showed the BTS members taking on the roles of live broadcasters which have become relatively common as more and more people seek a career in content creation  As the seven members, each took on their own specialities to become someone else for a day, their personalities were very visible  While one presented, the other six became the viewers and took on the job of communicating through comments only  Here&rsquo;s what went down with each of them 

Jungkook

While the youngest has often admitted to a lack of patience as he tries to learn things, he makes up for it by being good at all these activities right from the get-go  Jungkook has been interested in learning an instrument and it was the perfect fit as the BTS ARMY fulfilled their wish of seeing a rock-inspired Golden Maknae with this Run BTS episode  He took in-person lessons from a popular YouTuber &lsquo;Boogie Drum&rsquo; who taught the BTS member Butter on the drums  A super-focused Jungkook became the bane for the viewers aka BTS who bombarded his comments section with demands 

SUGA

The star rapper and producer promised to be more communicative and did just that as he picked up a brush instead of a guitar or a piano as most would have expected  SUGA began taking requests and the BTS member obliged with hilarious options  He finally decided to draw an egg and they kept calling him out for the lack of visibility and commented unfiltered making the painter lose his patience with them eventually, creating an even more comic scene  His attempt at drawing spicy noodles was funnier, even more so for the ones watching 

Jin
The BTS member has been known to spend a lot of time inside the comfort of his house playing away on his computer  Jin was given three games to try out and he began with a difficult-to-control skateboard game that he ended after flipping it twice  Next was an annoyingly difficult game for Jin whose secrets were unknown to others  Trying his best to control his emotions he tried his best but soon gave up  Onto the last game, a trick awaited in the form of horror as a round designed to fool the player was set up  The end was just as funny for the BTS member who was left alone as all the viewers but one left his chat room not letting him say goodbye  SUGA stayed back to support Jin and it was the most heartwarming moment of the episode 

J-Hope
A brief look at J-Hope&rsquo;s broadcast revealed him trying fun toys while the other BTS members cosplayed as kids  What will explode in this live? Part 2 will be released next week!

Episode 1 - Open

Kicking you off on the right foot, why not go right where the story first began? It&rsquo;s a short 3 minutes 41 seconds episode with the seven members introducing themselves and their upcoming shenanigans on what would become one of the most popular K-pop variety shows  It starts off with the group&rsquo;s take on their own &lsquo;Boyz With Fun&rsquo; which was released on the album &lsquo;The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1&rsquo; in 2015, the group was then promoting, as they tweaked the lyrics to launch their own program  It heads into the dance number &lsquo;Dope&rsquo; with its iconic &ldquo;Welcome, first time with BTS?&rdquo; They promote the app as well as their own show and peek into the chaos that awaits  Nothing better than getting right into it from the start 
5XisXVcbZEwEpisode 11 - Back to School

BTS returned with more regular episodes and increased the duration as well, after taking a break in early 2016  The following year they put out some of their most funny episodes and this one takes the crown for being one of the best ever  Another skit was performed, this time with their own script  Here the legendary Min Yoonji, SUGA&rsquo;s female alter ego came to be and has become a point of jest among the fans  More memes such as Jin screaming, RM breaking the toy gun, and more were made  In order to get one to understand the meme land of the BTS world, this is a very important episode 
VgzdortYQ6EEpisode 20 - Korean Food War

What happens when you put 7 non-cooks into a cooking studio and make them create? Chaotic fun, that&rsquo;s right  This was also the time that the theme song which is occasionally changed, was made to be their then-latest release &lsquo;Blood Sweat &amp; Tears&rsquo;  Member Jin is known to have little experience with cooking, he was made the chef for the day as he tried out the dishes made by two teams  Fans would remember how some very creative dishes were used for plating and at the same time, a super sticky concoction was also made 
KvehOunyO70Episode 24 - BTS versus Zombies

With the show getting popular, the scale of the shoots was also raising  BTS headed to the popular EVERLAND Resort at night time for their next &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; episode and it was right out of a horror movie  As soon as they were on their way, zombies took over their bus  They were assigned tasks while they also fought their fears- the zombies  The whole episode is a burst of fun as the BTS members get scared out of their wits and is a must-watch for unending laughter  They won coupons and did their best for more cackles 
KLzWCC74itEEpisode 33 - BTS X Manito 1

One of our personal favourites, we advise you to keep tissues handy as you might end up shedding tears from laughing too hard  BTS were made each other&rsquo;s Manito aka the person responsible for taking care of someone throughout the episode  In the first part of the two, they had gifts assigned for each person, hand-picked by the members themselves and also the task they had to complete in order to succeed  They ended up playing games and made some very photos while jumping  Not only the viewers, but the BTS members also ended up on the floor in splits while filming it

Dear Oppa: An Indian Stay remarks that Stray Kids’ Bangchan taught her kindness through his gestures,"Bangchan or Christopher Bang was born on October 3, 1997 in Seoul, South Korea. He is the leader, producer, songwriter, composer, lead vocalist, rapper and dancer of Stray Kids. In 2010, at the age of 13, he passed a local audition in Australia for the K-pop label JYP Entertainment. Despite his young age, he moved to Korea to train at JYPE. Today's heartwarming letter in our Dear Oppa series has been penned by Shruti from India to Stray Kids’ Bangchan. Read her letter below.Dear Bang Chan,I  still vividly remember the first video that made me a fan of yours. Even though it's the 21st century, talking about periods is not something what many men do, leave alone a male kpop idol. But YOU did. Fearlessly! Not caring about how controversial it might turn out to be. Little did I know that one video would change my life for the better. From being a naive 13 year old teen who left his country and trained hard for 7 years to becoming the leader of one of the most popular 4th Gen groups, you've proved time and again that you're indeed the ""best leader"". Your genius and talent never ceases to amaze and inspire me. The dedication you have towards your profession, your members and your fans is everything. ""Chan's Room"" has now become a comfort place for me and I would be lying if I say I do not wait for the weekends for those ""big hugs"". If I had to name one thing that I learned from you then that would be ""kindness"". The way you genuinely care for every single individual around you, make them feel comfortable and most importantly put them before yourself, not only shows your big heart but also how compassionate you are as a person. From encouraging us to be proud of the little demon that resides within us to comforting us by saying it's okay to cry and let it out to giving tips on how to deal with stress and anxiety, you've truly been a Guardian angel for us Stays. Honestly, I could go on talking about how much your kindness has given me the strength to endure these hard times, not just me but Stays and every other person who looks up to you. I truly hope that the next time you take a Buzzfeed quiz, the answer to ""Do you love yourself?"" would be a genuine YES accompanied with that dimpled smile. Sending you lots of warm hugs and hot chocolate. Till the last ""STEP OUT""!Love,ShrutiIndiaALSO READ: The World of the Married’s Park Hae Joon molds into a jobless comic writer in new posters for upcoming dramaThe magnificent celebration of K-world culminates with The HallyuTalk Awards, watch here.Want to let out in words, your undying fondness for your favourite K-drama and K-pop stars?

"BTS’ Jimin, J-Hope and RM share sweet birthday wishes for V; 4 BEST messages from past birthdays","BTS&#39; V&#39;s record was published in the 2023 edition of the Guinness World Records, which is published annually by Guinness World Records and sold worldwide. V&#39;s photos and records can be found in the &#39;Modern World&#39; section. Celebrating its 68th anniversary this year, the book boasts a staggering 138 million copies sold, with more than 3,500 new records published in more than 100 countries in more than 20 languages.

V&#39;s achievements:

On December 6 of last year, without notice, BTS opened individual Instagram accounts for each member and received enthusiastic responses. In particular, V attracted followers at a tremendous speed, recording 1 million followers in 43 minutes and 10 million followers in just 4 hours and 52 minutes, making it a Guinness World Record. He then broke the world record in the shortest time to reach 50 million followers, and on the 20th he became the first Korean male to reach 54 million followers.

His record:

A year later, the record is still unbroken. In addition to Guinness Records, V has set various records in the past year standing shoulder to shoulder with the world&#39;s top stars. Along with followers, in &#39;Like&#39;, the two most popular indicators, it set a record of exceeding 20 million &#39;Like&#39;, which only 10 people in the world have, and has 4.19 million &#39;Like&#39; posts for the first time in Asia.

V is also at the top of various popularity indicators, such as No. 1 in Google&#39;s &#39;most searched Asian celebrity&#39; for two consecutive years, the most page views on Wikipedia&#39;s K-pop solo, and the No. 1 increase in K-pop solo followers on Spotify in 2022.

V&#39;s popularity:

V received attention from all over the world by demonstrating a shining presence among numerous pop stars at the Grammy Awards ceremony. Both the Grammys and MTV cited V&#39;s performance at the Grammy Awards as one of her finest moments. He started his relationship with the Grammys by participating as a presenter at the &#39;61st Grammy Awards&#39; in 2019 with BTS. At the &#39;64th Grammy Awards&#39; held in April, he received rave reviews for his first solo stage performance in direct contact with the audience.

V&#39;s performance:

In particular, the British BBC picked the scene where V transforms into a spy and seduces Olivia Rodrigo as the &#39;Best Moment of the Grammy Awards&#39;. The LA Times praised V&#39;s performance at the Grammy Awards, saying, &quot;V&#39;s performance at the Grammy Awards was worth a million dollars.&quot; &#39;MTV&#39; selected a scene in which V and Olivia Rodrigo performed a butter performance with the article &quot;April, what is most of my cell phone backgrounds?&quot; as the highlight moment of the pop world in April.

The news that Rihanna became a mother, the Super Bowl halftime show with Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar, the news that Billie Eilish and her brother Phineas O&#39;Connell won the Oscar as the youngest artist ever for the theme song &#39;No Time To Die&#39; for the 007 movie, etc. was selected as the hottest issue of the month.

V was selected as the most searched Asian in Google Trends in 2022, and recorded the most mentions right after the Grammy Awards ceremony, proving the hot interest poured into V that day.&nbsp;

Jimin&#39;s wish:

On December 30th, Jimin posted a picture without any text. In the published photos, Jimin and V were captured. Jimin and V are posing for the camera in the rain. The appearance of the two creates a sense of warmth. Upon hearing this, V left a comment saying, &quot;I love you.&quot; BTS, to which Jimin and V belong, released the anthology album &#39;Proof&#39; in September of this year.

J-Hope&#39;s video:

J-Hope uploaded an unseen video of V dancing as they go out for a holiday. His dancing had the ARMYs melting over and the fans started talking about J-Hope&rsquo;s skills at taking the best videos and only uploading them during their birthdays. RM put up an Instagram story wishing V on his birthday with a blank background.&nbsp;

2019 wishes:

In 2019, Jimin put up some cute selfies of them together on V&rsquo;s birthday. For the first selfie, they were seen half in the water, a childish look selfie, them looking natural-faced and them together at the Niagara Falls.&nbsp;

J-Hope&#39;s wishes:

J-Hope did the same but except it was of them behind the scenes in the concerts, while they look amazing in various outfits.&nbsp;

Purple Banner:

He is known as the person who created &lsquo;I Purple You&rsquo; which means I love you, which he created for his ARMYs and using that, the fans have created multiple banners and birthday projects surrounding purple.

V&#39;s birthday surprise:

In 2018, they uploaded a video of surprising V right before their concert. Jimin is usually known as someone to decorate cakes for all the members&rsquo; birthdays and this one was no different. The cute cake was for V and he looked surprised and happy to see his members, that he considers his brothers, taking the time to wish him and celebrate his birthday with him.

Read her letter below.I'm writing this for SUGA (Min Yoongi) of BTSHAPPY PROMISE DAY Dear Yoongi,First of all, I want to say thank you for existing, your mere existence lights up my world. On the idea of this whole Valentine Week, the first person that comes to my mind is you :)I remember the first time I saw you. ‘Boy With Luv’ MV, ash grey hair, your rap and lip bites. I remember downloading your (and the other members’) pictures and fangirling over you.Let's admit, I have a crush on you, millions of people say this but trust me, thinking about you makes me giddy and I get all excited when I see your photos and videos. I really didn’t know how to say it or if I should because you're my idol. Having you just as an idol has brought me so much love and joy, so thank you for touching my life in such a beautiful way.But let me explain myself a little more. You deserve to know and hear how truly amazing you are, and it is quite unfortunate that letters like this don't actually reach you, but I'll try my best. &lt;333You're literally the most charming, determined, and hard-working person. I love how you're so professional, savage, yet such a soft, caring mushball.I also love and appreciate that you are sensitive, thoughtful, non-judgmental and a deep guy. I also really do think you are incredibly cute (and hot). However, that is not why I like you the way I do.I love that you are you and the way you make me feel. I love that you are kind, affectionate, thoughtful, so so funny, silly, and loving. I love that you are hard-working and passionate about your work. You inspire me so, so much.When I first saw you, I had no idea that you would end up meaning this much to me. I also had no idea that you would change my life and myself for the better.I just want you to be the happiest. I really love you with my whole heart.I promise to love you till the last day. I am definite that we'll meet someday. Thank you for making me feel special and giving me butterflies with your dope and flirty raps in the old Bangtan era.Wishing you a healthy, successful and prosperous life ahead.Saranghaeyo.- Anoushka VishnoiALSO READ: Dear Oppa: A fan from Ghana pens a letter cheering on actor Lee Joon GiWant to let out in words, your undying fondness for your favourite K-drama and K-pop stars?Email your open letter to: editorial@pinkvilla.com, mentioning your full name, country, IG handle and Twitter handle.

Despite that, they put up a show together and stole all of the limelight from the event that night. J-Hope, in his Weverse Interview, said that the Grammy performance was a letdown for him. The dancer was disappointed in himself. He wanted to put on a great show at the Grammys. He added that he couldn't tolerate the slightest letdown.

Jack In The Box Review: BTS’ J-Hope’s soul bearing attempt is soft in the feels but rough around the edges,"BTS member J-Hope has always been an ace, this time around- even more so  How?Jung Hoseok, born on February 18, 1994 is a South Korean rapper, singer, dancer, songwriter, record producer and the absolute source of everything bright and hopeful for his fellow members of the iconic septet BTS as well as their unimaginably large throng of fans, ARMYs spread around the world  But that’s all the information we already know of Making his first full length album release and being the first from his group to officially do so, J-Hope dropped ‘Jack In The Box’ on July 15  A couple of weeks since its release and the album has broken multiple records, understandably so  Today, we take a look at the many reasons why it works with a track by track breakdown of this 10-song record Intro: It is unbelievable if any other start to the album could be as perfect as this one, as it very obviously traces back to the roots of what being J-Hope stands for  Taking a page from the tale of ‘Pandora’s Box’ where ‘hope’ is the last remaining item, a woman’s voice reads out the story  It is genius and very reflective of the contents of the album Pandora’s Box: Right on cue, this track meets the audiences as a scroll from the past  J-Hope’s existence is painted over his will to go back to his basics to open his own box that reveals a token his moniker MORE: The pre-release single saw J-Hope taking on a challenging and effective peep into his journey as an artist and a thirst for even ‘MORE’  With old school hip-hop beats he admits to self-learning and his readiness to fail in the process of creating art STOP: The Korean name for the song translates to ‘There Are No Bad People In The World’ and it is depictive of J-Hope’s beliefs  A world riddled with sad happenings is still a world full of people who never wish to be bad  The artist’s humane tendencies rumble through the softer tones of the track where asks people to stop fighting, it’s more hopeful than decisive = (Equal Sign): The song is deep rooted into J-Hope’s understanding of people  He desires an equal stature and belts out the many reasons why he thinks it makes the perfect sense  “Hate'll paralyze your mind/ Gotta see the other side”, hopeful indeed Music Box : Reflection: It is the perfect breather to go over the class change in style of music that J-Hope has presented so far  The audio is that of an eerie music playing from the toy that the album’s art is based on What if…: The hip-hop industry’a attention was brought to this track particularly because of the presence of R  Diggs and R  Jones from the legendary Wu-Tang Clan in the credits  Interestingly J-Hope also has their song ‘Shimmy Shimmy Ya’ sampled for ‘What if…’  Lyrically, it’s a sharp breakage of J-Hope’s many fears  He talks to his own self as two different entities questioning the other’s existence and his desperation to be in the game Safety Zone: The most surprising one on the album, J-Hope once again lays himself bare with his inner thoughts of having no home to call his own while also having the privilege of being a star  In a life that’s a paradox, he wonders if there really is any ‘Safety Zone’ of his own Future: Much like the title, the artist raps of his many wants and haves  He counts the numerous steps that took to be where he is today and looks at the scary future lying ahead of him  It seems to be an almost acceptance of the struggles that he has so far chanted over the course of the album Arson: The title track for ‘Jack In The Box’, J-Hope recounts the many aspects of being himself and letting go of any inhibitions by burning them as a celebration of his glory  While the fire he lit to keep himself going has turned to an ‘Arson’, he wonders if he should keep going or stop Ahead of his monumental performance at the Lollapalooza music festival, we walked with J-Hope, through his many facades that he has to keep up for survival and his real self that wants nothing but to reveal itself  Breaking away from the expectations of a K-pop idol and putting himself to a test, J-Hope has hit quite the challenge for himself with this release  ‘Jack In The Box’ is brave and nerve-wracking but applaud worthy at the same time Join the biggest community of K-Pop fans live on Pinkvilla Rooms to get one step closer to your favourite K-Celebs!

"iKON, Kang Dong Won leave YG Entertainment after BIGBANG members; BLACKPINK to follow?","YG Entertainment was established by one-third of the famed Seo Taiji and Boys, Yang Hyung Suk  Groups like BIGBANG and 2NE1 who became the face of the Hallyu movement alongside those active in the same time frame originated from YG Entertainment and have continued to be regarded as some of the best K-pop groups ever  However, 2022 is turning out to be no less than a complete turnaround of the YG Entertainment roster &nbsp;

iKON

Boy group iKON&rsquo;s current members Kim Jinhwan, Bobby, Song Jun Hyeong, Kim Dong Hyuk, Koo Jun Hoe, and Jung Chan Woo, have all decided to part ways with YG Entertainment following their contract expiration  According to a statement by the agency on their official website, they will still be a part of the group and communicate with the fans through earlier social media channels  iKON&rsquo;s promotions will continue under the management of YG Entertainment, though their exclusive contract has ended &nbsp;

YG Entertainment&rsquo;s notice on iKON members&rsquo; departure

&ldquo;Hello, this is YG ENTERTAINMENT 

We would like to inform you that after a long discussion with the members of iKON (Kim Jinhwan, BOBBY, Song Yunhyeong, Koo Junhoe, Kim Donghyuk, and Jung Chanwoo) about future activities, we have agreed to respect each other&#39;s opinions and terminate the exclusive contract upon expiration of the contract period 

The 6 members of iKON will continue their activities as the group &#39;iKON&#39;  In addition to that, they will continue communication with iKONIC through their official SNS (social media accounts) including the official fan community platform Weverse as usual 

We sincerely thank iKON who has been with us as an artist until now  We look forward to supporting iKON&#39;s activities in various fields in the future  We would also like to thank iKONIC who have been with us for iKON&rsquo;s journey  We hope you can send your unchanging interest and encouragement to the members for their new start 

Thank you &rdquo;

As of now, it has been reported that iKON&rsquo;s 6 members are looking for a domestic agency to work with and continue their future activities  They are also reportedly in talks with 143 Entertainment for signing all of them 

Kang Dong Won

Actor Kang Dong Won who has been with YG Entertainment for 6 years has also decided to not renew his contract following the end of his tenure as revealed on December 30  He will no longer be managed by YG Entertainment and is reportedly set to be a free agent until he finds the right fit for his future promotions  Kang Dong Won first joined the agency in 2016 and renewed his contract twice after that &nbsp;

BLACKPINK

The wildly popular girl group with the members Jisoo, Jennie, Ros&eacute; and Lisa has made quite the name for itself ever since their debut in 2016  BLACKPINK&rsquo;s members have been associated with YG Entertainment even before their formation as the agency also managed their trainee life as well as their solo projects  Over the years, BLACKPINK has become a K-pop icon and continued to spread its charms globally, with an ongoing &lsquo;BORN PINK&rsquo; world tour following the release of their second full album earlier in the year &nbsp;

With the departure of so many artists, their renewal is also being questioned  According to reports, BLACKPINK is discussing moving to THEBLACKLABEL as is being told by industry insiders  THEBLACKLABEL which Teddy manages will reportedly handle all activities of the group after having completed discussions about their contracts earlier this year  Teddy is a creative director and songwriter who has been behind multiple hits by BLACKPINK and used to be a producer at YG Entertainment  If the news is true, the members will only move to the sister label for management and are likely to continue their full group activities under YG Entertainment 

BLACKPINK moving to THEBLACKLABEL?
Regarding the girl group, a YG Entertainment representative reportedly clarified the rumours with, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing I can confirm regarding the news  What I can say is that our contracts with the members have not ended yet  It&#39;s hard to confirm whether they will sign with The Black Label or not after their contracts end &rdquo; Another report said that the agency completely denied the transfer calling it groundless 

BIGBANG

Earlier this week, it was reported that BIGBANG members Daesung and Taeyang have both left YG Entertainment  Meanwhile, leader G-Dragon&rsquo;s contract is still under discussion  While Daesung moved to THEBLACKLABEL, a subsidiary of YG Entertainment which was co-founded by Teddy, Taeyang will only associate with the agency for BIGBANG promotions  Member T O P was the first to leave YG Entertainment a few months ago  The quartet will still be under YG Entertainment for group activities &nbsp;

Previously, TREASURE members, Yedam and Mashiho left the group and the agency after terminating their contracts and deciding to take on a different path &nbsp;

In the midst of all this, YG Entertainment has shared a teaser for one of their upcoming projects, a new girl group  All eyes are on the company for its future plans &nbsp;

RM at the interview:

Recently, RM appeared on a South Korean news show for an in-depth interview and talked about various things, from Indigo to Jin enlisting  When asked about the enlistment, he said that his enlistment can be said to be the end of Act 1 and the beginning of Act 2 in the success narrative of BTS, which has grown steeply from their debut to conquering the American market  In fact, ahead of this, the solo activities of the seven members of the BTS started in earnest, and Jungkook, Jin, and RM, led by J-Hope, released new albums or new songs one after another

And their fan base ARMY is quick to defend and protect the boys if they feel someone is being derogatory towards them.

Who are BTS?

Bangtan Boys, popularly known as BTS, are the most famous boy band in South Korea  Formed in 2010, when they are not creating music or writing their own lyrics, they are improving the country&rsquo;s GDP  According to Entrepreneur, they single-handedly helped produce 0 30% of the country&rsquo;s output  Reaching beyond the boundaries of South Korea, BTS is a global sensation, appearing in many Hollywood talk shows hosted by Ellen, Jimmy Fallon, and many more &nbsp;

The lyricism of BTS is well-known  From philosophy to self-love, BTS has it all covered in melody 

So, let&rsquo;s look at 10 quotes by BTS you can metaphorically hug to sleep this winter -

1  &nbsp;When RM strikes a chord, again

&quot;I&#39;ve had to accept that - that everyone cannot love me  Because when there&#39;s love, there&#39;s hate  When there&#39;s light, there&#39;s dark  But it was really hard to accept as an artist that there&#39;s a lot of people that hate me, but on the other side, there are many more people who love me  I think everyone goes through that&rdquo; - RM (via Seventeen Magazine)

This is probably the most heartfelt quote made by the leader RM and it resonated with many &nbsp;

2  Quickly rkive-ing quotes to live by

&quot;We&rsquo;re on some path that&rsquo;s set since we&rsquo;re born, but I still believe we can change some things  So I believe in my faith but I still don&rsquo;t believe in my fate &quot;- RM

If this doesn&rsquo;t give Perks of Being a Wallflower Charlie then what does?

3  Feels like a hug

&nbsp;&ldquo;I really want to say that everyone in the world is lonely and everyone is sad, and if we know that everyone is suffering and lonely, I hope we can create an environment where we can ask for help and say things are hard when they&rsquo;re hard and say that we miss someone when we miss them &rdquo;- Suga

No words, just feelings &nbsp;

4  Cookie to Jungkookie

&quot;Effort makes you  You will regret someday if you don&rsquo;t do your best now  Don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s too late but keep working on it  It takes time, but there&rsquo;s nothing that gets worse due to practicing  So practice  You may get depressed, but it&rsquo;s evidence that you are doing good&quot;- Jungkook

Give a cookie to Jungkookie for turning that hustle mode on &nbsp;

5  The lyrics of Zero O&rsquo;Clock make sense now

&ldquo;If any of you feels lost in the face of uncertainty or the pressure of starting anew, don&rsquo;t rush  Take a deep breath  You may find that any moment can be turned into opportunity &rdquo;- Jin

The lyrics of Zero O&rsquo;Clock &ldquo;Will something be different?/ It won&#39;t be something like that/ But this/ day will be over/ When the minute and second hands overlap/ The world holds its breath for a little while/ Zero o&#39;clock&rdquo; is actually written by Jin and it all makes sense now 

6  Trust the process

&ldquo;I feel like I live with a sense of mission  Rather than thinking, It has to be perfect! I do what I have to do, making sure I remember the really important and fundamental things and trust that the results will follow &rdquo;- J-Hope

The true philosopher of the lot &nbsp;

7  It&rsquo;s okay to be not okay

&ldquo;We are all in different parts of the world, in different environments and circumstances, but at this moment, I hope we can all give each other a warm pat on the back and say, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s okay &rsquo;&rdquo;- Jimin

BTS don&rsquo;t sympathize, they empathize with the youth &nbsp;

8  Pause this moment

&ldquo;When things get hard, stop for awhile and look back and see how far you&rsquo;ve come  Don&rsquo;t forget how rewarding it is  You are the most beautiful flower, more than anyone else in this world&rdquo; - V

This quote is for times when like Chris from Into The Wild, you need to feel strong more than actually being strong &nbsp;

9  &nbsp;When you need a mantra to chant every morning

&quot;You do need to study, but don&rsquo;t suffer due to it  Because you might miss what you want to do because of it  You need to make your own dream  It&rsquo;s heartbreaking if you&rsquo;re forced by others &rdquo; - Jungkook

This is your daily reminder to not quit and keep on believing &nbsp;

10  Inspiration for weekdays

&ldquo;Life is tough and things don&rsquo;t always work out well, but we should be brave and go on with our lives &rdquo; - Suga

BTS ARMY and Seventeen's Carats get into a fanwar after Vernon aka Choi Hansol's comment in an interview spark off debate,"Whether it is BTS or SEVENTEEN, both the K-pop groups have loyal and protective fans. In fact, both are under HYBE. SEVENTEEN has been touring in North America to packed audiences. The 13 member group is known for their talent in music production. In fact, other than BTS they are one of the most successful boy groups around. An American channel interviewed them and asked Seventeen if they imagined that they would be as successful as BTS when they made their debut. Now, BTS made their debut in 2013 while Seventeen made their entry in 2015. Both the groups have members who are passionate about music production Seventeen gave an interview to the channel Sirius XM and the interviewer asked them, ""When you started the band, there’s no way you expected that you’d be up there just like BTS. That you’d be at the same level as BTS."" Vernon aka Choi Hansol who was taking most of the questions replied in a very mature and graceful manner. He said, ""When we debuted, BTS wasn’t the BTS today either. So, it’s really crazy what we’re doing right now and where we are at right now."" He is not factually incorrect. BTS started making headlines in the West after 2016. Moreover, the comparison question was totally uncalled for. Both the groups are super talented and passionate as performers However, some sections of ARMY and Carats are dragging the issue on social media. The former feels that Vernon could have shown some more respect to BTS who are their seniors. Carats feel Vernon was right in his own way. Neutral fans feel that BTS members are pals with Seventeen so there is no need to diss one another. Take a look at the tweets Vernon aka Choi Hansol is a Korean-American rapper. He was born in New York but moved to Korea as a kid. He is half Korean and half Caucasian. Seventeen is one of the most acclaimed groups like BTS in K-Pop",2022-09-15T07:00:00Z,1,1

BTS member Jimin stands just behind him, propped on foot  Jimin&rsquo;s usual sensual presence is just as visible in this photo as he wears a shining leather jacket, loose black pants and chunky boots  The red and black theme is common on both the artists &nbsp;
Possibly, one of the most shocking collaborations to ever happen in the history of K-pop, &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo; marks the amalgamation of the long-riding skills honed by BIGBANG and its members within its fandom ever since their debut in 2006 and adds the massive influence of BTS and the septet&rsquo;s individual talents since their debut in 2013 to bring forth a groundbreaking release that will definitely make for a drop being talked about for years to come &nbsp;

It was in early December of 2022, that the reports about Taeyang working with BTS member Jimin first broke out  While many found it hard to believe their eyes, others celebrated this unforgettable collaboration that was seemingly in the works  At the time, YG Entertainment responded with no confirmation and only asked fans to stay excited about the soloist&rsquo;s upcoming activities &nbsp;

&nbsp;

Just as his agency change was announced, Taeyang took to his Instagram to share a couple of photos  Captioning them &lsquo;#2023&rsquo;, it was obvious that the singer was raising the hype meter for his release  However, there was another person in the photos whose back was to the camera  Netizens turned on their detective sides and were quick to figure out that it was none other than BTS&rsquo; Jimin thanks to his hairstyle and adorable hands  The single was as good as confirmed now  To add to that, BTS member J-Hope clicked a like on the photo, which further solidified the fans&rsquo; thoughts &nbsp;

G-Dragon&rsquo;s support

A Japanese fan has said that she became a K-Pop fan in 2017, and BTS was her fave It seems she became famous because of the high quality pics that she took when she went to their concerts. This led to her being approached by a Korean sasaeng. She was given a 'job' to spy on the boys and take their pics. It seems she took up the offer because she needed the money. However, the sasaeng culture is very exhausting and found it worrying when she started enjoying the act of spying on the boys. The fan has said that her sister found out that she is a sasaeng and sent her for therapy. The girl has said that she is regretful of her actions and understands how sasaeng culture is harmful Even today Jimin said that some fans were calling him when he was doing his VLive with J-Hope after the Lollapalooza Festival.

"MBTI: Stray Kids’ Hyunjin, SEVENTEEN’s DK, BLACKPINK’s Jennie: 17 K-Pop idols that identify as INFP","MBTI stands for Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and it is an introspective self-report questionnaire which helps sectioning people into 16 different personality types  INFP stands for Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling and Prospecting  They are known as an idealist or mediators and are known to be the shyest amongst all types  They are imaginative and are led by belief, faith and their heart rather than their head  They are quiet but open-minded  They heal and take care of matters in a group  Being emotional, they are extremely empathetic and care for the people and environment around them  Here are some K-Pop idols that are exactly as described :-&nbsp;

Stray Kids&rsquo; Hyunjin

Known as one of the visuals and dancers of Stray Kids, Hyunjin has always been loved for his talents but beyond that, he is a caring individual who works hard to be a rock for other members in any way and is empathetic  He is a funny guy who entertains others but at the same time, he spends time caring for others and the environment around him, like a typical INFP&nbsp;

SEVENTEEN&rsquo;s DK, S Coups, Jun and Hoshi&nbsp;

This group has the most amount of INFPs, which is a rare occurrence since INFPs are imaginative but aren&rsquo;t as entertaining as other personality types  DK is a talented vocalist and is known to be an emotional person who always takes care of his members in any way he can  S Coups, being the leader, is known to be fiercely protective of his members and fights anyone who wrongs them  Being the oldest, he acts as a father figure to them and it shows in whatever he does  Jun is a quiet one and represents every INFP who has big ideas but cannot express them well while Hoshi seems extremely social onscreen, he is actually reserved and quiet offscreen and rather keeps to himself during his time off &nbsp;

Red Velvet&rsquo;s Yeri and Joy

The maknae of the group, Yeri is known to be cheeky and is always seen making fun of her &lsquo;unnies&rsquo; in the best way and they let her because she is the youngest  Besides her wit, she is an imaginative person and stands by her values at any given time  She isn&rsquo;t quiet but she is good at tightening her lip in certain situations  Joy is known for her pretty smile and amazing visuals  She is usually quiet but her bright personality radiates off her wherever she goes &nbsp;

BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Jennie&nbsp;

One of the most popular K-Pop idols in the world, Jennie did not lose her personality in the midst of it all, remaining mysterious and caring towards her members and other friends  Her true personality comes alive only around people she trusts but at the same time, she uses creative sensibility in her work, which shines through &nbsp;

ATEEZ&rsquo;s Hongjoong and San&nbsp;

While all of ATEEZ members seem like extroverted people, Hongjoong and San have been identified as INFP and it seems to suit them  Hongjoong, being a leader and producer of the group, is extremely creative, caring and protective towards his members while San is imaginative and is the right person to have a deep conversation with &nbsp;

NCT DREAM&rsquo;s Chenle&nbsp;

Chenle is the sassy vocalist of NCT DREAM and while he seems extroverted, he is actually introverted and often has troubles opening up about his troubles to his members, they have complained about that often  Being attached to music, he is creative and enjoys music in all forms  Despite his issue with opening up, he still maintains his likability and many members in NCT love his personality &nbsp;

IU&nbsp;

A celebrated soloist and actress, IU is undoubtedly one of the most popular public figures of South Korea  She is known to be quiet, reserved and usually keeps to herself which is different from how she portrays herself in her MVs and the characters she takes on  Despite being quiet, she is loved for her personality and empathy she constantly shows towards her fans and staff &nbsp;

Oh My Girl&rsquo;s Arin&nbsp;

A visual, talented actress and a great variety show personality, Arin is also seen as a reserved and quiet member of Oh My Girl but she is also seen as a caring individual who tries to keep everyone happy around her  She also has difficulty opening up to others and she has a true personality she shows only to the people closest to her 

THE BOYZ&rsquo;s Kevin, Jacob, Younghoon and New&nbsp;

The reserved quartet of THE BOYZ- Kevin, Jacob, Younghoon and New have a similar kind of personality where they seem more reserved and quiet but are actually fun, quirky and social in certain situations  They are talented, sweet and extremely empathetic  They are always seen to care for others

What BTS' RM has to say about Elon Musk agreeing for the boys to be next CEOs of Twitter ,"BTS has been ruling the Twitter-verse for years now, with them being some of the most talked about personalities on the platform  Individually or as a group, often some hashtag or mention related to the septet finds its way to the trending topics around the world as millions of fans celebrate every moment related to the group 

Elon Musk&rsquo;s Twitter

The Tesla and SpaceX boss, Elon Musk expressed his wish to own Twitter earlier in the year and after many hurdles and disputes, was able to buy the social media platform  He recently expressed his wish to pass on the baton by appointing someone new as the CEO, as he left the decision to a poll  Suggestions came pouring in with some suitable and some downright hilarious options of people who could lead the platform efficiently 

BTS as Twitter CEOs

It was DJ Swivel, the Canadian music producer who has previously worked with BTS on multiple tracks, writing, and remixing them for the members and the group as a whole, who had the brilliant idea  He tweeted, &ldquo;I think @BTS_twt should become the joint Twitter CEO&rsquo;s @elonmusk &ldquo; tagging the BTS members&rsquo; account and Elon Musk being as hands-on as ever replied with, &ldquo;Great idea&rdquo; 

RM&rsquo;s reaction

BTS&rsquo; leader RM who is known to be lurking on social media all the time found the tweet and seemed to have let out a laugh at the interaction  He shared the exchange on his Instagram story with a laughing emoji  RM did not seem averse to the idea, so when can we expect the change, Mr  Elon Musk?
Meanwhile, RM recently made his solo debut with the album &lsquo;Indigo&rsquo; which has received global praise for its lyricism and the wide spectrum of artists working on it

"EXCLUSIVE: Balming Tiger on self-defining K-pop genre, collabs with BTS’ RM and SEVENTEEN’s Vernon","Balming Tiger was fresh off of a live reaction, the first from them, for the SEXY NUKIM music video feat  RM of BTS, however, our pile of questions awaited, and kind as ever the seven of them were ready to answer them all 

Alternative K-pop band
Standing out from the rest, Balming Tiger defined themselves as “A Multi-National Alternative K-pop band and Asian Arts & Culture Collective ” On asking, the group uncovered the very reason they decided to use Alternative K-pop as their genre- they wished to be free from the shackles of set norms and put themselves under an umbrella that would allow them to continue making music of all kinds  Genius, we think 

Growing influence
Balming Tiger is very well aware of the millions riding Hallyu and in this storm of interest, they wish to make themselves and others like them constants in world music  Their goal? Longevity in the influence of Korean culture  And to take a step in the right direction, they brought in inarguably one of the most crucial elements characteristically anchoring the Korean wave - BTS - and worked with leader RM to be able to reach a wider audience and they’ve done just that as the song rocked atop multiple music charts 

Working with other artists
Collaborations come very naturally to the group, whose Omega Sapien shared the details of his solo work ‘Wrecker’ with SEVENTEEN’s Vernon  They’ve been friends for a while and a random meeting saw him suggest the idea to the same-aged K-pop star who happily agreed to be a part of the release 

On the other hand, roping in RM may not have been a tough mountain to climb either, as the collective’s leader, San Yawn, rubbed elbows with the very acclaimed producer, Supreme Boi, who has been credited for superhit tracks like ‘Dionysus’ and ‘Idol’ by BTS, and ‘Cat & Dog (English Version)’ by TOMORROW X TOGETHER, to name a few  San Yawn and Supreme Boi belong to the same alumnus that both decided to drop out of, a fact we cheered about during our talk  They’re both doing fabulously well, after all 

Their charm
Balming Tiger is not unknown to the Korean crowd who have previously grooved to their domestically viral release ‘Kolo Kolo’, which also happens to be our personal favourite  One look at their discography and you can easily notice that they’re quirky, full of ideas and oozing with talent- a part of which the unversed were able to witness through SEXY NUKIM 

During our conversation, the group dished about the many secret details of their collaborative song- how it was to be shot in another country originally, how they reacted to RM’s first try on his SEXY NUKIM verse, how different each of their experiences was while shooting the music video and how they acknowledge that this is only the start for them 

Over an hour of deep conversations, laughs and cultural exchange later- the collective was ready to hop on the plane for their show the next morning and we parted ways with their fascination about us deciding to “입덕” (ipdeok) aka stan them!

Hardly, it was very natural, just like their collaborations

23 beloved K-pop idols who spoke about their mental health,"One of the best things about today&#39;s generation is that they are vocal about mental health, want to learn about it, and want to spread awareness about it  Now, this is a super important and sensitive subject considering how severe the impacts of ill mental health can be, especially if you are working in the entertainment industry and have to fit certain criteria every time you are in front of the camera 

&nbsp;

With their polished makeup, constant media attention, glitzy outfits, extreme diets, well-curated social media feeds, pressure to perform, and millions of adoring fans - it becomes difficult to see our favored K-pop celebs as one of us, regular humans  More often than not, we viewers idolize our on-screen K-pop stars and look up to them  And the topics of mental health, personal struggles, and illnesses are not something that is often discussed in the K-pop industry 

&nbsp;

So, their opening up about their mental health struggles is equally brave and an eye-opener for all their followers  Not only do our favorite K-pop idols reveal the harsh reality of being in front of the camera 24*7, but they also tell the world that no one battling depression, anxiety, or any other form of mental illness is alone! We are there to support you, we believe in you, and most importantly, we care about you - there is no shame in seeking help or talking about your mental health struggles  On the contrary, our K-pop idols encourage us to open up about our mental health battles just like they do - be it in the form of their songs or in their candid interviews 

&nbsp;

So, today we will talk about some of your beloved K-pop idols who spoke about their mental health, the impact, and how they dealt with it 

&nbsp;

Once again, please remember that you are not alone (hugs) 

&nbsp;

(Trigger Warning&nbsp;-&nbsp;This article contains references to mental illness, mental health struggles, eating disorders, depression, anxiety, and suicide )

&nbsp;

23 beloved K-pop idols who spoke about their mental health

&nbsp;

SUGA (BTS)
One of the strongest voices within the Korean music industry backing mental health is the 29-year-old rapper SUGA  He has frequently spoken up about his battles with depression, social anxiety, and OCD while offering condolence to his fans worldwide who feel alone in their mental battles 

The BTS member opened up about his mental struggles back in 2016 when he released Agust D, his first mixtape  In that mixtape, he built an alter-ego who resisted all societal expectations but had a vulnerability that allowed him to rift the topic of mental health 

In Agust D, SUGA raps,

&nbsp;

&quot;On the other side of the famous idol rapper

Stands my weak self, it&rsquo;s a bit dangerous

Depression, OCD

They keep coming back again from time to time &quot;

&nbsp;

Once again, in May 2021, in an interview with Rolling Stone, SUGA explained his mental health as cold weather wherein negative emotions come and go  He added that people must be encouraged to share their mental health struggles, rather than silently suffering and keeping it to themselves 

&nbsp;

This BTS member has often used music and songs like The Last to look introspectively and address the depression and anxiety that he faces 

He has also openly spoken about mental health disorders during many interviews  In one such interview, Suga stated, &quot;loneliness and anxiety stay forever  How you choose to make peace with them needs a lifetime of contemplation &quot;

&nbsp;

RM (BTS)
BTS members have never shied away from openly speaking about rough and sensitive issues that the youths of today face 

So, when RM fans questioned him about his well-being - when he hosted a live broadcast to celebrate his 27th birthday on 12 September - he replied, &quot;every day is a fight to not lose to depression and not giving up &quot;

&nbsp;

We, as his fans and followers, are pleased to see that he spoke about his mental well-being and is making time for activities, like cleaning his room, exercising, and watering plants, that support his physical as well as mental health 

&nbsp;

Bae Suzy (Miss A)
Bae Suzy has been in the public eye ever since the debut of Miss A in 2010  She was merely 15 years old when she was thrust into fame  While being an actor and K-pop idol got her stardom, she was beyond stressed and battled depression during the initial years of her career 

&nbsp;

Juggling between Miss A&#39;s promotions and her acting projects, Suzy was pushed to the brink and even burst into tears in front of her close friend  She spoke about her mental health struggles during a talk show, Healing Camp, on SBS  She even blatantly called out to people who forgot that she was merely a child 

&nbsp;

The former member of Miss A appears to be doing considerably better and also released an English number, Cape, which is the perspective of being someone&#39;s aid as they steer through their mental health issues 

&nbsp;

Kang Daniel
Kang Daniel, the former member of Wanna One, has always been honest about his battles with mental illness  Not only has he been vocal about it, but he even based an entire album, Yellow, around this subject  This album included songs like Paranoia and Antidote and was released in April 2021  The songs were a reference to the three-month-long break that he took in November 2019 to focus on his mental well-being after dealing with anxiety, depression, and panic disorders  Fortunately, this much-needed break seemed to help him with how he felt about himself and the industry (in general), and he definitely returned feeling much stronger and better!

&nbsp;

In an interview with NME, Kang Daniel stated,

&quot;I don&rsquo;t think I have changed, but I feel like there has been a change  I still read bad comments, but because I was able to overcome them once, I can just deal with them now  There is a certain way to do that, and I trust myself and the people around me to help me  There are good days and bad days, but there is always a reason to live  There are good things about life, and that is what I look for now &quot;

&nbsp;

Jeongyeon (Twice)
JYP Entertainment announced in August 2021 that Twice&#39;s Jeongyeon would take her second break owing to psychological anxiety and panic disorder  The company further added that while she did perform at the 30th Seoul Music Awards (at the end of January) with her entire group, both parties have mutually decided to prioritize her mental health  Jeongyeon also took to Bubble, a messaging app, to assure her fans and followers that she would return feeling better and healthier 

&nbsp;

Jae (Day6)
Jae, Day6&#39;s member, had a near-death experience in 2020 when he suffered a panic attack while driving  He thought he could live through his anxiety and sweep things under the rug  That was until things reached a critical point  Since then, Jae has taken actions, such as medication, to help with his mental condition  Plus, he is also actively raising awareness about mental health illness and toxic positivity 

&nbsp;

S Coups (SEVENTEEN)
Undoubtedly, K-pop idols are stressed owing to the high expectations of their viewers and fans  However, nobody compares when it comes to the leaders of the respective bands and groups  The leader of the band, SEVENTEEN, S Coups is one such example  He had to take a pause from band activities when the symptoms of his anxiety did not allow him to participate in the world tour of Ode To You 

&nbsp;

He, too, did not shy away from speaking about it  In a behind-the-scenes series, titled Hit The Road, S Coups spoke about his emotions, saying that he tried to ride out but ultimately decided to take a break  He further stated that although performing brought him happiness, he did not want things to change due to his mental health issues 

&nbsp;

Lee Ji-Eun, a-k-a IU
IU is undoubtedly one of the cutest and most well-known female K-pop idols  She was only a teenager when she debuted as a K-pop soloist (without having other people or members to lean on as in bands)  However, not only did she eventually find her footing in the Korean industry, she went on to become one of the most immensely successful artists 

&nbsp;

What fans may not is that this popular Palette singer suffered from Bulimia Nervosa, a potentially life-threatening and harmful eating disorder, in the earlier days of her career  This also unconsciously manifested as anxiety about her weight  Moreover, she even had to follow an extreme diet (dubbed the IU diet) to lose weight (as per Korean beauty standards) for an acting project 

&nbsp;

Although despite everything, she did not back down and spoke about her experiences in 2014 at SBS&#39; Healing Camp  She stated that she sought help for her anxiety issue and Bulimia  Furthermore, IU also highlighted the fact of how much stress is faced by all the K-pop idols, emotionally referring to the loss of one of her dear friends as they took their own life 

&nbsp;

In 2018, during her speech at the Golden Disc&nbsp;Awards, she urged her fellow artists to prioritize themselves and openly and honestly express their emotions - before comforting their fans (as the old adage goes, &quot;help yourselves so that you can help others &quot;)

&nbsp;

Jonghyun (SHINee)
Though it seems almost impossible to bring up his name without referring to his death (he took his own life after struggling with depression) in 2017, SHINee&#39;s vocalist Kim Jonghyun was one of the very first K-pop idols and the loudest voices to speak up about mental health 

&nbsp;

Jonghyun used his fame and Korean platform to shed light on significant issues and taboos surrounding mental health  He literally had done it all - from openly handling queries about mental health on Blue Night, his radio show, to supporting a trans fan who bravely opened up about their struggles 

&nbsp;

Moreover, this K-pop idol even spoke up about his own depression in the songs, Let Me Out (which he himself penned down) and A Gloomy Clock by IU (featuring Jonghyun) 

&nbsp;

Kim Hyun-ah, a-k-a HyunA
In 2016, HyunA was hospitalized and diagnosed with panic disorders and depression  It took a year for Kim, the former 4Minute band member, to come to terms with her mental condition 

&nbsp;

Kim Hyun-ah, a-k-a HyunA, revealed in a letter that she had actually wanted to keep her mental health illness a secret, but she could not hide it further 

She even wrote, &ldquo;I am bravely going to keep trying to be well, but I think people can not be perfect  I think it is not too late  I am going to love myself and take care of myself  I am going to be courageous and honest like I am now &rdquo;

&nbsp;

Hani (EXID)
It has been quite a while since Hani has been speaking up about her interest in becoming a psychotherapist post her career as a K-pop idol 

&nbsp;

Having dealt with her own mental health struggles during her career, Hani expressed her wish to work specifically with K-Pop idols as she knows how tough their lives can be 

&nbsp;

Kwon Mina (AOA)
In 2020, there were rumors that the former AOA member Kwon Mina was bullied by Jimin, their band&rsquo;s leader, while other members stayed silent 

In July 2021, one year after these allegations surfaced, it was reported that she had attempted to take her own life 

&nbsp;

After regaining consciousness, Mina announced her plans to take serious legal action against the bullying rumors spread by netizens  In September 2021, Dispatch, the Korean news outlet, released messages between the AOA band members, including Jimin and Kwon, in which they had discussed the bullying issue 

&nbsp;

Taeyeon (Girls&rsquo; Generation)
Following the death of her close friends Jonghyun and Sulli, several of her fans were concerned about her mental health condition  Back in June 2019, during an Instagram question-and-answer session, Taeyeon got candid when someone rudely asked her if she had bipolar disorder and ended it with a &quot;tsk tsk &quot;

&nbsp;

She revealed that she was suffering from depression and was taking medicine and working hard to get better  She also stated that she seems most vulnerable and at her worst after she is done with her touring and concerts and is left feeling alone without being surrounded by many people  Further, she commented, &quot;whether it is bipolar disorder or depression, do not just &quot;tsk tsk&quot; people and look at them negatively  They are all patients who are sick and in pain &quot;

&nbsp;

Her response was hugely appreciated and appropriately critical  However, since then she has not spoken much about her mental health condition 

&nbsp;

Jay B (Got7)
In March 2021, in an interview with ARENA Magazine, the former Got7 member Jay B announced that he had been diagnosed with clinical depression which actually came to him as a surprise  He stated, &quot;I thought I was just mentally weaker than other people &quot;

&nbsp;

In May 2021, in an interview with Allure, he once again spoke candidly about his anxiety and depression  He further shared, &quot;for more than 3-4 years, I have felt extreme pressure and burden as an artist, but instead of taking medication, I often hid those feelings away &rdquo;

&nbsp;

Thankfully, Jay B started taking therapy and medication after his diagnosis  he even shared that he is getting better after getting the proper help  After his experience, he has frequently encouraged his fans and followers to confidently talk about these kinds of problems and to seek professional help, if needed, for their own mental well-being  He also acknowledged the fact that there is no shame in prioritizing yourself and taking care of your mental health 

&nbsp;

Renjun (NCT)
NCT&#39;s Renjun is one of the most outspoken members, especially when it comes to talking about mental health illnesses and disorders  Although he has never been specific about what he is battling, Renjun has often talked about how he has had a hard time and learned art therapy from a teacher, which proved to be incredibly beneficial for him 

&nbsp;

He took to Twitter to express himself and stated,

&quot;There was a point where I really had a hard time, but I met a good teacher  I draw, it&#39;s called art therapy, it&#39;s healing your mind through drawing, and I met a teacher who helps people who have hard times, they became a great help in my life  What is hard is that I am an adult encountering society and looking for a way to handle it, but since I&#39;m young and inexperienced  It&#39;s as if I put my hand here, and it hurts like hell, but (there is no) way  So when I was like that, the teacher guided me well, and I became the person that I am today with the thoughts I have right now &quot;

&nbsp;

Wendy (Red Velvet)
In an episode of Mysterious Record Shop, Red Velvet&#39;s Wendy spoke up about obtaining psychological help for the mental difficulties that she had been facing 

&nbsp;

She stated,

&quot;When we are promoting, we do not have a break  I don&rsquo;t think I should express my hardships  I did not know it myself because I was hiding all these things &rdquo;

Furthermore, Wendy said,

&quot;I was more apprehensive about others and did not focus and prioritize my own needs  However, I finally plucked the courage to go for counseling with a psychologist because I was biting my tail and biting my tail&rdquo; 

&nbsp;

Han (Stray Kids)
Stray Kids&#39; member Han is not the only band member to have discussed having trouble with his mental health  He has also spoken about having social anxiety in certain situations 

&nbsp;

In December 2019, JYP Entertainment had also announced that Han would be taking a break from some fan signs due to intermittent psychological anxiety  Moreover, he also used to breaks during some of the promotional events of the band owing to his anxiety 

&nbsp;

Thankfully, his fans quickly sent their support and showered him with their love at the time  Also, he revealed that his anxiety disorder seems to be more stable nowadays 

&nbsp;

f(x) Sulli
Sulli was a highly popular former member of the South Korean pop girl group f(x)  Sully was outspoken by nature with overtly sexual tones and was often caught in disfavor amongst many Koreans  She was even cyberbullied for her persona, with many followers leaving numerous negative comments on her social media 

&nbsp;

She had struggled with social phobia, panic disorder, and depression before she died on October 2019 

&nbsp;

Goo Hara (Kara)
Kara&#39;s Goo Hara and Sulli were very close friends, and only a month after her death, news broke about Goo&rsquo;s death  Goo Hara, a former member of the girl group Kara, suffered grave bouts of cyberbullying and online criticism because of her sex video scandal with Choi Jong-bum  Goo Hara&#39;s former boyfriend, Choi, was a hairdresser and had assaulted her, threatening to release a sex video of the two  Though Choi was ultimately put into jail, things went much worse for Goo Hara as she was brutally trolled and harassed on social media 

&nbsp;

Goo Hara had released a musical single, and only a week later came the news of her shocking death, which took her fans by utmost surprise 

&nbsp;

Leeteuk (Super Junior)
Leeteuk, a member of the K-pop band Super Junior, is well-known for his outspoken persona and variety of capabilities  Leeteuk has often spoken that he is battling depression 

&nbsp;

Not only did he reveal his struggle with mental illness, he even expressed his painful family background  He revealed how his father murdered his frail grandparents and took his own life, leaving him with a debt of five billion dollars ($5,835) that he had to work off 

&nbsp;

Kim Heechul (Super Junior)
Heechul is yet another member of the K-pop group Super Junior who is vastly known for his outspoken and hilarious persona on South Korean variety shows, including Knowing Bros (2015 - present) 

&nbsp;

However, behind all those laughs is a person struggling with depression  Heechul was a close friend of Jonghyun and Sulli  After the death of Kara&#39;s Goo Hara, he privatized his Instagram account to deal with the loss  As per the reports, he also shut himself down for about three months when Hankyung, a former Super Junior member, left the group 

&nbsp;

Cha In-ha
Cha In-ha, aged 27, was a young newbie K-pop actor who passed in December 2019  He made his debut in 2017 with Temperature of Love, a Korean TV drama  He was starring in Love with Flaws at the time of his death 

&nbsp;

As his death followed the deaths of two other K-pop idols - Goo Hara and Sulli - many fans and followers started raising apprehensions about copycat suicides  A slightly bizarre fact is that neither did he leave a will or a message nor did his family request an autopsy  It was assumed that he took his own life after struggling with mental health issues 

&nbsp;

Yeonwoo (Momoland)
Yeonwoo had previously taken a break from the promotions of the girl group Momoland  This gap even resulted in sparking rumors that she was leaving the group 

&nbsp;

However, the agency waved away all such rumors and claimed that Yeonwoo was getting treatment for her mental condition of panic disorder  Ultimately, she started to feel better, left her girl group, and started her solo career as a K-pop actress 

&nbsp;

Conclusion
Being a celebrity with global influence is never easy  Behind the curtains, our beloved K-pop idols often go through a lot of pressure in the course of their careers  And at times, navigating life constantly dealing with mental health issues can become overwhelming and tough 

&nbsp;

So, rather than nonchalantly dusting off this rather sensitive issue, these K-pop idols openly spoke up about their mental health disorders and their impacts  Apart from these K-pop idols, even G-Dragon and MONSTA X&#39;s Joohooney have also been open about their mental health issues and struggles 

&nbsp;

Hopefully, you will support your favorite K-pop artists and also take their advice to reach out for help if and when you need it 

&nbsp;

If you need support or know someone who is struggling, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist or speak to someone about it  There are multiple helplines available for the same 

&nbsp;

Once again, please remember that you are not alone!

BLACKPINK accused of lip-syncing at MTV VMAs 2022; Fans outraged,"On August 28, 2022, BLACKPINK, the popular K-pop girl band, performed for the first time at the MTV Video Music Awards show in New Jersey  Although it was a merry-ride for the band&#39;s fandom known as BLINK, the popular magazine Variety called out the girl band and stated that they lip-synced the songs in their performance  Not only that, but the reputed magazine also called the musical group &quot;repeat offenders &quot; Check out the full story here!
BLACKPINK lip-synced at the MTV VMAs 2022, alleges Variety

In a recent article, listing &quot;The Best and Worst Moments of the 2022 MTV VMAs&quot;, Variety author Thania Garcia put BLACKPINK and a couple of other artists who performed at the awards show under scrutiny, calling them &quot;repeat offenders &quot; The magazine stated that although BLACKPINK members &quot;devoted attention to their killer dance routines&quot;, they lip-synced their songs 

Even though the author pointed out the &quot;tricky&quot; business and the amount of hard work that goes into the award shows, fans were outraged by the magazine&#39;s allegations  While some of them went on to criticize Variety for spreading misinformation, BLINK (BLACKPINK fandom) members, which is one of the most popular fan groups in the industry, straight up stated that the magazine is doing it for clickbait and knows how the fans will react 

Many fans rose to defend their favorite K-pop band BLACKPINK, pointing out that the members, Jisoo, Ros&eacute;, Jennie, and Lisa, did not lip-sync their performance  The fans stated that they could hear the band members hitting their mics and breathing onto them  Several BLINK members also took their opinions and complains to the article&#39;s comments section, bashing the publication for their allegations 

Now, it is true that BLACKPINK used AR (All-Recorded), which is commonly used in award shows to enhance the live performances of artists  However, it is not synonymous with lip-syncing  It is essentially pre-recorded back vocals and music that plays in the background 

Following this, many pointed out that Brazilian singer Anitta and rapper Flo Milli, other artists who were listed by Variety, also did not lip-sync  In fact, many outraged individuals took to Twitter to demand an apology from Variety for falsely accusing BLACKPINK and the other artists of lip-syncing 

You can check out the entire performance of BLACKPINK&#39;s new album song &quot;Pink Venom&quot; at the MTV VMAs attached right below  Also, let us know your opinions on it in the comments below

It seems he spent the night at the monastery soaking into the Buddhist culture. A couple of pics were also released of Namjoon and San Yawn sitting with the monks. It seems he met Venerable Deokmon of the temple. The global icon can be seen in a black hoodie. They are also reported that he donates 500 bags every year for kindergarten kids in the Philippines. Now, it looks like RM aka Kim Namjoon of BTS is not impressed with such detailed coverage of the place. He wrote that if things are meant to be low key then they should be kept low key on his Insta stories. He said he would visit some other temple next time around. In fact, he also deleted his Instagram posts from that visit In fact, people had begun speculating if he is a Buddhist or just interested in the philosophy after seeing the pics. The monks apparently said that he came to do some contemplation and seek inspiration for new music. ARMY is upset with how casually people disregard his requests It is a little disappointing given how Namjoon aka RM shares the most with fans. Maybe they should have asked him for consent at least. In fact, details of his conversation with the monk was also released. He was asked about his view on joining military service. It seems he said he should fulfill duty first and then ask for rights. Well, ARMY is sending love to the BTS leader",2023-01-05T05:41:50Z,1,1

BTS’ RM’s low key visit to temple turns public as monk shares private comments on military enlistment,"BTS member RM is known to enjoy nature and everything calm in his down time  He frequently visits museums, galleries, temples, art festivals and more with his close friends and fellow music industry people for mental peace and to soak in the warmth  This has led to the coining of the term &lsquo;Namjoon-ing&rsquo; which combines his real name Kim Namjoon with the art of revelling in natural habitats &nbsp;

RM recently went to the Hwaeomsa Temple in Mount Jirisan and shared photos from his visit on his Instagram account  He was accompanied by the alternative K-pop group Balming Tiger&rsquo;s member San Yawn who also shared photos from the snow-clad location where the two seem to have stayed for a while 

Details of RM&rsquo;s visit revealed

On January 4, reports were released about RM visiting the Hwaeomsa Temple to experience the traditional Buddhist culture of a thousand-year-old temple  Further information such as his one night two days stay on the 29th of last month and his chat with the head monk Venerable Deokmun of the temple were talked about  His conversation about wanting to visit the place earlier as well as the past donations of 500 bags every year to Good World Charity Bank, a children&#39;s relief organization and their use by kids in the Philippines, was made public through reports 

RM on his military enlistment

It seems that RM had a chat with the head monk about his upcoming enlistment who asked him about his feelings on not receiving military exemption and if he was sad  To this, the BTS leader is said to have replied with wise words saying that as a citizen of South Korea, he wishes to fulfil his duty and only then he will be able to speak about rights  He added that he would think of the experience as turning into an adult &nbsp;

The monk is said to have replied with considering a year and a half out of his 80 years life span as precious time to look back on and not a waste  Venerable Deokmun reportedly wished that BTS&#39; RM continues to make good music even when he becomes old, and added that he wished they would help others just as much love as BTS has received from global fans  He further continued that he hoped the group would become an existence that transcends music instead of someone that easily disappears &nbsp;

RM&rsquo;s signed copy of his recently released album &lsquo;Indigo&rsquo; which was given to the head monk was also revealed through photos shared with the media 

RM&rsquo;s response

On January 5, BTS member RM took to his Instagram stories to react to the reports made about his visit  He seemingly called out the temple for publicizing his private visit as he wrote, &ldquo;I was grateful for the time spent there, but didn&rsquo;t expect an article about it&hellip;&rdquo; and added a laughing emoji to it  He made his plans clear for future visits which he would like to be private, saying &ldquo;Next time I&rsquo;ll quietly visit another temple &rdquo;
RM seemed unimpressed with the actions of the temple as he spoke about how he likes to move usually, which is low-key  He further made a very clear statement calling them out by hashtagging &ldquo;low key must be low key&rdquo; in his last Instagram story  The BTS member also removed his post with photos from his visit to the temple from his feed expressing his wishes 
RM visiting another art gallery

In different news, the BTS member recently made a stop at the Gyeongnam Museum of Art in Changwon to see the Lee Kunhee special exhibition  His attendance was only noted on following his visit and seeing the photos he shared on his Instagram  RM has become quite popular in the art industry for his interest in collecting pieces that are not only well-known but also the ones that he personally enjoys or finds meaning in  The officials of Gyeongnam Museum of Art said that they were unaware of his visit and believe that the singer quietly saw the exhibition and returned 

Fans of the BTS member are in full support of him asking for privacy and calling out the actions of the temple officials who unbeknownst to him made his comments on his military enlistment public as well as the details of past donations 

Meanwhile, RM recently dropped his solo debut album &lsquo;Indigo&rsquo; on December 2, 2022 which consists of 10 tracks led by the immensely passionate &lsquo;Wild flower&rsquo;  He worked on the songs from the studio album with multiple artists from around the world to make a critically praised release  It follows his two previous mixtapes, &lsquo;RM&rsquo; and &lsquo;mono&rsquo; which were released in 2015 and 2018 respectively

"BTS: SUGA aka Min Yoongi drops shirtless pics in artistic photoshoot; ARMY has a wild meltdown, 'This is so unprovoked' [View Tweets]","BTS Chapter 2 is exactly the opposite of what BTS chapter 1 has been. The boys have been exploring themselves as artists and their individual personalities more openly. The old BTS ARMY is in shock and is kinda having a tough time dealing with it. Ever since the BTS members – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook – entered chapter 2, they have become bolder. Well, the ARMY knows what it means. One by one, each of the BTS members have been opening a thirst trap and right now, a wild meltdown is happening and it's all thanks to Min Yoongi aka Suga Hollywood News and Twitter is trending and buzzing because of BTS member Min Yoongi aka Suga. His latest photoshoot has sent shockwaves amongst the ARMY. Suga usually is not that active on Instagram and it's great because whenever he comes online, he causes mayhem. And that's what he's done even now. Min Yoongi went shirtless. He dropped 4 pictures, two of the same aesthetics. The First set is about Suga, shirtless and his neck covered in flowers. The second set is Suga, still shirtless, but with a single-shade abstract threaded headgear. AgustD put a monkey-shying emoticon in the caption, that's it It is not known whether the pictures that the Run BTS hitmaker shared are from his Photo folio series. But it will be J-Hope's Photo series that will be released before that of Suga. Well, let Suga reveal all in his own time. Meanwhile, he would be enjoying the wild thirst trap he started after dropping the photos. ARMY is going berserk over his photoshoot Meanwhile, Suga had That That with Psy which was released in May last year. It also won big at the MAMA 2022. He has his own drinking show on YouTube. Talking about his mandatory military service, it is been said that he might fulfil his mandatory services as a social service agent instead of an active duty soldier",2023-01-05T11:24:44Z,1,11
RIP Queen Elizabeth II: BTS ARMY revisits the theory of Princess Diana reincarnating as Jungkook after the demise of the royal [View Tweets],"A faction of BTS ARMY can be very imaginative. As we know, there are a lot of theories on how Princess Diana reincarnated as Jungkook. She passed away on August 31, 1997 and as we know, Jungkook was born on September 1, 1997. Some fans have drawn many similarities between the popular princess and Jungkook like how their smiles look similar, and even shared pics of them in cardigans with matching prints. Yesterday, the Queen of England Elizabeth II passed away at the age of 96. It is a huge loss for Great Britain. The Queen had been active till old age, and was seen as a role model by many Yesterday, BTS also did a VLive for Chuseok, which is the three day festival of Korea. It is a harvest festival, and time when folks visit extended families and relatives. All the members were there but Jungkook was too sleepy. He said he had medicines for an allergy which could have made him drowsy. Some weird fans started off a conversation that he was possessed by the spirit of late Princess Diana on the day of the demise of the Queen Of England. The hashtag #Jungkook began trending under the topic of the royal family. This is how people reacted on the same But this has not impressed many including BTS ARMYs. They feel such a conversation has been started by someone who is a hater. The Queen of England held a special place in the hearts of UK citizens. Making such a theory on the day of her demise looks insensitive. As we know, a nation is in mourning. BTS has always conducted themselves with utmost dignity.

"5 K-pop groups you need to check out NOW: NewJeans, PENTAGON and more","K-pop is spreading &ldquo;smooth like butter&rdquo; all over the globe, and no one is safe from its &lsquo;Pink Venom&rsquo;  The industry is showing no sign of &lsquo;Shut Down&rsquo; anytime soon  K-pop fever is taking over the world &nbsp;

What is K-pop

K-pop actually means Korean Popular music  It is a mix and match of many genres that includes, but is not limited to, pop, rock, hip-hop, R&amp;B, etc  What makes K-pop so unique is that the artists are not limited to one genre  K-pop is really experimental  K-pop groups usually have at least one rapper in them, be it BLACKPINK or BTS  Also, the K-pop language is not strictly limited to Korean  Many languages are mixed and matched in songs, such as in the case of groups like MAMAMOO or SEVENTEEN where English phrases are increasingly being used  This got them brownie points in the global market further increasing their chances of going global &nbsp;

Global K-pop-ularity

According to Korea JoongAng Daily, when it comes to the sudden global K-pop fever, timing is the main key  They trace it back to Spotify&rsquo;s decision to launch the K-pop Hub, but that played a minor role compared to social media and algorithms  And while they report it as mainly a timing thing, the K-pop industry had been laying the bricks of the foundation for its rise for a long time  They always wanted to enter the foreign market  From concerts and events abroad to including more and more English hooks in their songs, the rise can be best described as a domino effect 

As a result, Indonesia, Japan, and the Philippines surpassed South Korea in K-pop related tweets as revealed by Twitter last year &nbsp;&nbsp;

So, now that we have our basics right, let&rsquo;s look at the top 10 new K-pop groups that you need to check out, like, right NOW &nbsp;

3  Stray Kids

Stray Kids is what you need working on weekdays because it&rsquo;s basically store-bought adrenaline  With high-spirited music and rapping, along with fabulous dance performances, they refuse to let you feel sad while you are listening to them  They are yet another promising group coming out of JYP Entertainment and they came through a reality show of the same name  The eight horsemen of the group are Bang Chan, Lee Know, Changbin, Hyunjin, Han, Felix, Seungmin, and I N  They have managed to achieve great success in the past year thanks to their successful releases

While the hyungs were enjoying the pizza, the two youngest tried not to give in to their cravings  Sat beside each other, the maknaes were controlling their urge to grab a bite from the many tasty-looking slices while the older members lightly teased them about it  It became a fight against their own decisions as the two members were on diet and stuck to not caving into the wants  Jungkook even went ahead and held a slice right against V&rsquo;s nose just to see if he would be tempted but the &lsquo;Sweet Night&rsquo; singer stuck to his resolve &nbsp;

Jin&rsquo;s &ldquo;controversial&rdquo; toppings remark

The &lsquo;The Astronaut&rsquo; hitmaker gobbled down the pizza and praised all the mouthwatering toppings as the other members agreed  However, there was one particular comment that made global fans do a double take  Jin raved about the pickles he was eating with his pizza and asked, &ldquo;How do people overseas eat pizza without pickles?&rdquo;  While many questioned his topping choices, others came to his defence saying that he meant radish pickles and not the cucumber ones trying to make the situation better, launching a hilarious discourse across social media about his pick 

The game of 16

BTS started light with a card game where they put their minds to test  Putting their matha and addition skills to test, SUGA was the first one out while the rest fought it out with numbers  Towards the end, as only members Jimin, Jin and RM stayed, the former&rsquo;s move made RM yell out &lsquo;Shibow&rsquo; (fifteen: shib means ten + ow meaning five) making everyone flustered as the pronunciation is too close to a Korean cuss word  They clarified the same amidst fits of laughter and disbelief  The first game&rsquo;s winner was Jimin, followed by the ranks in order: RM, Jin, J-Hope, V, Jungkook and SUGA, who came in last 

The &lsquo;Liar&rsquo; game

BTS played an upgraded version of the famed mafia game as they were divided into two teams in each round: the liar team and the citizens/villagers team  While they all tried their best to fool each other and find out who the actual liars are, it was only more apparent how well the BTS members knew each other and were accustomed to their presence  To add to the fun, each one of them was given electroencephalograph cat ears  As they lied or tried to be cheeky, the ears moved and made them look adorable  When a question about if they liked to take showers frequently or not was raised, they failed to lie and the liar team was found out easily  The next question was about them having fruity faces and though they faltered, it became a hilarious round of guessing who was which fruit  The last question was about dancing when sad and soon the fingers were pointed once again  In the end, the game came to a close with Jungkook being rightfully picked as the liar 

The following week&rsquo;s episode was teased next with more fun games at the expense of the BTS members who are always ready to unleash their funny sides  After the group events, it is time for solo games that will earn the members more points and hopefully, a reward awaits them at the end 
nYyAQ_w0qGcAbout Run BTS

The famed variety show was begun by the South Korean septet in 2015  It did not gain the numbers it currently boasts right off the bat as it first started slowly with smaller episodes that introduced the group member&rsquo;s traits to the world  Over time, their charms had the fans hoodwinked, and as the global influence, as well as their amount of fans, grew, so did the interest in their non-music activities, with the primary focus on &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo;  The show took a break of 10 months and returned late last year with special episodes released every few weeks to keep the momentum going

"Lee Min Ho, Gong Hyo turn 'crazy and stupid' in BTS PICS from Ask the Stars set: 6 things to know about show","Who doesn&rsquo;t love the little behind-the-scenes shenanigans of your favorite shows or K-pop idols? Actor Lee Min Ho shared a few BTS photos along with his co-star Gong Hyo Jin from the sets of their upcoming K-drama &lsquo;Ask the Stars&rsquo;  Our excitement for this new series is only growing thanks to these images 

Let&rsquo;s give you more insights into the show and its lead stars 

Lee Min Ho and Gong Hyo Jin&rsquo;s chemistry

Lee Min Ho posted some adorable pictures of himself and Gong Hyo Jin chilling in the winter yesterday  The leads of &lsquo;Ask the Stars&rsquo; are both dressed in winter attire, looking all cute and adorable  From the collection of photos he posted, we can tell that these two have visible chemistry  It undoubtedly increases our excitement for the start of this drama 

Additionally, we are unable to determine if the other two pictures&mdash;of the traffic light and the snow-covered road&mdash;have any connection to the drama or were merely casually shared by Lee Min Ho 

These snippets undoubtedly increase our excitement for the start of this drama 

                                                                                    
                                                                                    
                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                What to expect from the series Ask the Stars?

Ask the Stars is a sci-fi romantic comedy-drama where an astronaut Eve Kim and a space tourist Gong Ryong meet and fall in love at a space station  Gong Ryong, an OB-GYN (obstetrician-gynecologist) who has a strong sense of duty, visits a space station as a tourist and meets Korean-American astronaut Eve Kim there 

The leads

Lee Min Ho will take on the role of OB-GYN Gong Ryong who paid an exorbitant sum of money to fly to space as a tourist  Gong Hyo Jin will portray the accomplished astronaut captain Eve Kim, a stickler for accuracy who will not put up with any errors  We may infer from the plot of the drama that it will be a tale of hatred and love, with the lady taking on the tougher path  This is undoubtedly such a welcome change 

With the previously released images, it was clear that Gong Hyo Jin will play a lady with a strong sense of self who pursues her goals  We can definitely see that the tables have turned for the actor Lee Min Ho, where in most of his romantic series we have seen him taking the lead in romantic situations but possibly in this one he&#39;ll be the one being tamed, and that surely excites us &nbsp;

Cast lineup

The star-studded ensemble of &lsquo;Ask The Stars&rsquo;, which also features Oh Jung Se, Han Ji Eun, Lee El, and others, has also drawn a lot of attention  Han Ji Eun plays the CEO of Mirae Electronics, Choi Go Eun  Choi Go Eun is Gong Ryong&#39;s fianc&eacute;  Oh Jung Se will be seen portraying Kang Kang Su, a space experiment specialist who has spent 10 months in the space station  And finally, we see Kim Joo Hun playing Park Dong Ah, an experienced astronaut who has visited the space station three times and is a member of Seoul&#39;s MCC with Eve Kim 

The team behind Ask the Stars

The drama is helmed by director Park Shin Woo who has also directed some fine works like &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Okay to Not Be Okay&rsquo; and &lsquo;Lovestruck in the City&rsquo;, while the script is penned by writer Seo Sook Hyang, known for hits like &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Dare to Dream&rsquo; (Jealousy Incarnate) and &lsquo;Pasta&rsquo;  The exquisite intricacies in her earlier drama, &lsquo;Wok of Love&rsquo;, has also received attention  The past cooperation of the writer-director team on &lsquo;Jealousy Incarnate&rsquo; has raised hopes for this one  The entire ensemble has been putting in a lot of effort each day to learn wire action, which calls for a high degree of technical proficiency to accurately convey the feeling of weightlessness within the spaceship 

Lee Min Ho and Gong Hyo Jin&rsquo;s experience

On November 18, 2021, the leading Hallyu actor Lee Min Ho and the distinguished actress Gong Hyo Jin was said to be in negotiations to play the lead parts in this new drama series  Finally, on March 28, 2022, Lee Min Ho and Gong Hyo Jin were confirmed as the leads, and ever since, all the fans have done is wait 

As well as appearing in the dramas &lsquo;The King: The Eternal Monarch&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Heirs&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Legend of the Blue Sea&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Boys Over Flowers&rsquo;, Lee Min Ho also starred in the 2021 Apple TV+ original &quot;Pachinko&rdquo;  &lsquo;Ask The Stars&rsquo; will be Lee Min Ho&rsquo;s first small-screen project in the last two years and will mark his first show since Apple TV&rsquo;s &lsquo;Pachinko&rsquo; 

Gong Hyo Jin has most starred in these K-dramas, including &lsquo;When the Camellia Blooms&rsquo;, &lsquo;Don&#39;t Dare to Dream&rsquo; (&lsquo;Jealousy Incarnate&rsquo;), &lsquo;The Producers&rsquo;, and &lsquo;It&#39;s Okay, That&#39;s Love&rsquo;, among others  She recently got married to musician Kevin Oh  This is the actor&#39;s first performance following her wedding 

&lsquo;Ask the Stars&rsquo; is developing into a highly anticipated drama with a sizable budget, an intriguing story premise, and an excellent star ensemble  What excites you the most about Lee Min Ho and Gong Hyo Jin&#39;s next drama?&nbsp; Do let Pinkvilla know what you feel about the upcoming drama in the comment section

Back in 2013, right around the time of his debut with BTS, the idol had admitted that BIGBANG&rsquo;s Taeyang was the K-pop superstar he looked up to, revered the most, and had then hoped to perform together on the same stage! This endeavour is nothing less than Jimin&#39;s ultimate dream collaboration since he will be working with the guy who inspired him throughout his formative years in the business 

The already Hype of the song VIBE

All of this felt like a dream or a rumour a few days ago  Recently, some pictures that Taeyang posted that gave us a peek at the behind-the-scenes activities from his recording studio went viral  In them, he can be seen working on a new song with a musician who strikingly resembles Jimin  The BTS vocalist was quickly identified by his fans  Additionally, J-Hope liked the image, supporting fans&#39; suspicions that the two will be working together soon 

And it was later on confirmed by Taeyang&rsquo;s agency THEBLACKLABEL with the first teaser of the song hitting social media on January 4  Even BTS&#39; official handle confirmed the collaboration with BIGBANG member Taeyang  The song is set to drop on January 13 at 2 p m  KST (10:30 am IST)

"BTS: SUGA aka Min Yoongi and RM's 'XL and L' conversation puts ARMY in disarray; fans say, 'Spare us some life'","BTS members seem to be using Instagram as their new group chat. From discussing on meeting up for drinks to talks on strawberries, Instagram is now their go to place. BTS member SUGA aka Min Yoongi is not very active on Instagram. Make no mistake his posts get better engagement than others. Yesterday, he decided to make his debut with the comments section. He asked RM aka Kim Namjoon what size would he (SUGA) need to buy of the jogger pants. As we know, BTS HYBE merch is driving fans crazy. RM had designed jogger pants and a wind chime. The jogger pants are out of stock but we guess as a BTS member SUGA has his privileges RM told him that SUGA wore L while he was XL. In his second comment, RM said he could have asked this size related information on group chat rather than on Instagram. Needless to say, fans began discussing how the boys use Instagram as  group chat nowadays. Many were shocked to know that SUGA buys clothing in size L. Others pointed out that he has broad shoulders unlike other members. RM has buffed up immensely so it is not surprising that he needs XL. After all, most fans know him as 'Little Kitten' and 'Smol Bean' . Fans also reminisced about the time RM said that SUGA and he wore same size underwear. After living together for 11 years, they are as familiar to each other as husband and wife. In fact, RM had once said that if he did not like his impulsive buys he could easily pass them to SUGA as they wear same size ARMY cannot get over this #NamGi interaction. RM's idea to put this on Kakao Talk is perhaps because he guessed what kind of conversation it would inspires in ARMYs. The septet is assumed to get back to work by end of January 2022. This is the first time that they're spending time with families in holiday season. BTS is the global phenomenon in the world of music",2022-01-19T08:00:00Z,1,13

Here are some of the highlight moments from the first episode:- 

1  RM and SUGA’s intro clip

As RM enters the screen, he begins with congratulating SUGA on beginning his YoutTube career and they talk about their pre-debut activities as well as being vloggers  Their sweet interactions show how close they are and their bond  

2  SUGA being proud of RM

SUGA congratulates RM on creating 200 songs with the release of the solo album and RM humbly counters with SUGA’s achievements which he deflects and we get to see two humble artists trying to put the other one up on the pedestal  Suga also delves into seeing RM during the album making process  RM also revealed that J-Hope was the first and only one to listen to the entire album before release and he said that it was because J-Hope got him to listen to his solo album Jack In The Box before the release  Being someone who does not reveal his work before release, he felt like he owed him that, which is such a sweet gesture 

3  RM talks about his album

He said that he began creating tracks for Indigo in 2018 or 2019 between the group and solo schedules and essentially created a 2019-2022 diary that encompassed all his feelings and thoughts of nearing the end of his 20s, which is captured beautifully in the song Forg_tful with Kim Sawol, a talented folk artist  He also talked about writing Wild Flower while he was taking a long walk in Seoul one night and used the environment as an inspiration for him 

4  SUGA talks about Daechwita 

As RM talks about struggling with writing lyrics sometimes, SUGA delves into talking about his Daechwita writing process and said that since it was created earlier, writing the second verse was always harder and hurried to finish the song  

5  RM takes inspiration from Adele 

While talking about the album name, he said that since he used to wear a lot of black, he called his album mono  while after release, he started wearing many colors, which inspired him to name his album Indigo  He also pointed out how Adele named her albums based on the age of when she wrote and finds himself similar to her 

6  They talk about 2025 

RM talks about that by 2025, he would be back from military service and would create songs for the members who would still be doing their service and want themselves to not be scared for the future and rather be present  He also presents 2025 as a monumental year as the ground-breaking album The Most Beautiful Moment in Life would complete 10 years and would do something special for that year

Sometimes, Taehyung steals everything just with his expressions. ARMYs go gaga all the time Last but not least, we have the Golden Maknae Jungkook on the list. Jungkook is usually considered a baby. But everyone knows he's not a baby. Jungkook loves working out and ARMY loves his boxing videos a lot. Sadly, he deleted them all. Jungkook has a different aura on stage and he always sets the stage on fire. Especially ever since he has started keeping long hair. Jungkook also loves to flaunt his abs.

NCT's Haechan to halt all activities due to health issues: 5 things to know about NCT 127's tour,"SM Entertainment, the management company for NCT, announced on January 6th, 2023 that Haechan will not be taking part in the upcoming NCT 127 tour because of his major health issues  It was reported that he had been missing some of the group&rsquo;s activities &nbsp;

Here&rsquo;s more on what we know about his health and the tour 

NCT Haechan&rsquo;s health issues

A member of the K-pop boy band NCT Dream named Haechan, who was recently promoted to NCT Dream following the release of their new remake song &quot;Candy,&quot; took a sabbatical from his activities because of health issues  In a notice released on Jan  6 by SM Entertainment, NCT&rsquo;s agency said that Haechan will miss scheduled events of the tour pertaining to his poor health &nbsp;

Just a while back, Haechan had encountered unusual symptoms including chest tightness, heart palpitations, and more  His manager drove him to the emergency department, where he underwent consultation and examination and was given the diagnosis of needing treatment and rest as required  Haechan is said to not participate in any planned events and won&#39;t be present for the US and Latin American legs of NCT 127&#39;s &quot;Neo City: The Link&quot; concert tour, which will begin on January 9 and run through January 28  Haechan&#39;s health rehabilitation is of utmost importance and he only wishes to get well sooner by resting and has decided to abstain from all planned events starting this week 

As soon as he confirms his return, the agency promises to inform his followers of the same  They also genuinely regret any inconvenience caused to the fans and beg for their understanding that this choice was necessary for Haechan&#39;s well-being  The agency pledges to do whatever is necessary, to work hard and to help Haechan so that he may meet the fans with a healthier image 

What are the dates of the tour?

The band NCT kickstarted their world tour back in October 2022, after the release of their fourth studio album, 2 Baddies  NCT 127 has performed in many places like LA, Jakarta, Bangkok, Korea, etc  Following this enthusiasm, NCT 127 decided to excite its fans in the United States once again  NCT 127 revealed nine additional dates for their forthcoming Neo City: The Link globe tour on December 8, 2022  Seven more locations, including Chicago and Houston in the United States, S&atilde;o Paulo, and Santiago in Latin America, will host performances by the K-pop boy band  The K-pop superstar will perform during the revised dates, which are January 9&ndash;January 28 of 2023 

What are the exact city lineups?

According to the poster, three further gigs are scheduled for Chicago on January 9, Houston on January 11, and Atlanta on January 13  NCT 127 will next go to Latin America where they will perform six performances in four different locations  They will begin by performing in Sao Paulo, Brazil from January 18 to 20, then move on to Santiago, Chile on January 22, Bogota, Colombia on January 25, and Mexico on January 28  With such lineups, we can only conclude that this is NCT&#39;s largest tour in America, and the band&#39;s followers are eagerly anticipating an amazing live performance 

Haechan will miss NCT 127&#39;s Tours in Latin America and the US

Haechan was notified that he would not take the stage on the next NCT 127 US and Latin American tour dates for obvious health issues  Having a member absent from the schedule because of illness is not the first time the NCT has encountered such a situation  Jaehyun had the same issue before, and Mark Lee had also spoken about his exhaustion during the group&rsquo;s comeback 

Who will attend?

Haechan&#39;s absence owing to his sickness means that NCT 127 will now play on this tour with fewer members  The other 8 members&mdash;Yuta Nakamoto, Jaeyun, Taeyong, Jungwoo, Mark Lee, WINWIN, Doyoung, Johnny, and Taeil&mdash;will take part in the USA/Latin America performances as planned  This is one of the most loved sub-units of the SM Entertainment group NCT, and their tickets usually get quickly sold out  Hopefully, the fans will finally get to see at least 8 members at the end of the month, minus Haechan  We are certain that the concert will still be wonderful even without Haechan because the other members will all be present 

NCT 127&rsquo;s much-needed comeback

We can only be more thrilled for the band NCT 127 to make their comeback now that the tour has begun and their repackaged album Ay-Yo will be released later this month 

Having said that, Haechan is presently taking care of himself and hoping that he will soon feel well  We can only hope that he meets all of his fans and gets back with his band soon  We wish him a quick recovery

BTS V aka Kim Taehyung had the easiest one out of all. He suggested striking his signature V pose for the pictures Out of them all Jimin, Jungkook and Jin had difficult postures. Jimin's posture was that of sitting on a chair in the air. Jin's was a hard side-way lean which almost tripped Taehyung. But the most difficult of it all was Jungkook's posture. It was a Yoga posture wherein one balances his/her body on his hand. And right away, the idea was rejected by the members. It's funny and relatable at the same time. Jungkook is fond of exercising and working out. So are others but sometimes, the things that Jungkook does easily are difficult for the rest of the Bangtan Boys Meanwhile, during Festa Dinner this year, the BTS members announced that they will be taking a break from the hectic work schedule as the boyband.

Happy Birthday Jin:  When the BTS member showed his fanboy side for Brad Pitt,"While the whole world is fanboying over him and his fellow bandmates, BTS member Jin has never shied away from showing one celebrity he truly loves and is a massive fan of  The singer&#39;s love for Brad Pitt has also become &#39;worldwide famous&#39; just like his worldwide handsome title  Brad Pitt may have many fans but we bet there&#39;s no one as dedicated as Kim Seok-jin &nbsp;

Jin&#39;s &#39;Hollywood crush&#39;&nbsp;

It all started back in 2017 when Jin first namedropped Pitt and left everyone surprised  The Astronaut singer also received a rather funny reaction from his bandmates after he answered a question for an Access Hollywood interview  Jin created an iconic moment when he named Brad Pitt as his &quot;Hollywood crush&quot; and chose to name the actor as his favourite instead of any actress &nbsp;

Jin&#39;s dream collaboration&nbsp;

On another occasion, the singer once again proved his love for Brad Pitt and it was when the members were being interviewed on iHeartRadio Live in 2020 where they discussed their MAP OF THE SOUL: 7 album, their 2020 world tour, their new collaboration with Lauv, and more  It was during this interaction that the members were asked about future collaborations and whom they would like to work with next  The answers from the members turned out to be interesting as V name Ariana Grande, Suga picked Post Malone  Although when it came to Jin, the singer once again left everyone stumped with his answer when he said, Brad Pitt &nbsp;

Instead of picking another musical artist, Jin picked Pitt above everyone and that shows what a true fanboy he is of the Bullet Train star  His answer also provoked a response from RM who joked, &quot;He&rsquo;s gonna shoot a movie &quot; Although the thought of Jin and Brad Pitt acting together certainly left ARMYs screaming with joy given how they have been waiting to watch Jin explore his actor side as well &nbsp;

Jin&#39;s celebrity fans&nbsp;

While Jin may be a Brad Pitt fanboy, the singer and group members are themselves big celebrities and enjoy a massive celebrity fandom as well  From &nbsp;Thai actor Chalongrat Novsamron to Egyptian actress Somaya Elkhashab, there are many celebrities who have named Jin as their BTS bias  Also, TXT member &nbsp;Soobin, the leader of the group is a big fanboy of Jin  Soobin has not only mentioned how he is a fan of Jin&#39;s voice but also had the sweetest things to say about the BTS member as he said during a live session, &quot;Seokjin hyung is so handsome, he&rsquo;s really handsome  He&rsquo;s really likable, gentle and calm and&hellip;he has a face that I want to resemble  He&rsquo;s really elegantly handsome&hellip;I like him a lot&quot;, via All K-Pop &nbsp;

Not only that, but Coldplay frontman Chris Martin also has a special sport for Jin in his heart and it was evident during their recent show together in Argentina  In his introduction for Jin&#39;s performance, Chris opened up about how Jin had approached him about finding a song &quot;that says goodbye to everybody for a little while &quot; He said, &quot;And so, about six months ago, one of their members called me up and he said, &lsquo;I have to leave the band in December for two years, I have to join the army in Korea because that&rsquo;s the rule &rsquo; And he said, &#39;I need a song that says goodbye to everybody for a little while &#39;&quot; During the performance Jin and Chris were seen sharing a warm hug on stage as well, showcasing their adorable bond

From their first meet at their shared salon, to when they went viral because of their many funny moments  One of these incidents was when they sat beside each other in the artists section of the 2018 Mnet Asian Music Awards  As V returned to join the rest of the BTS members, there was not enough room for him and so he decided to grab a seat in front of them  Looking at this, CHUNG HA and Sunmi who were beside leader RM got up to offer their spot to V who gratefully accepted it

The eldest hyung of BTS has collaborated with Max Martin, Chris Martin, Moses Martin and the whole Coldplay band for his new single. The video promises to be a great one.

BTS: Kim Taehyung and Jennie Kim face nasty body-shaming comments as their fans fight it out on social media [Read Tweets],"BTS member Kim Taehyung was in the news from May to September for his alleged dating rumours with Blackpink rapper Jennie Kim. The whole thing got rather disgusting with a spate of leaked pics that were allegedly hacked from the phone of the Blackpink star. There was no confirmation on the dating rumors from Big Hit Music or YG Entertainment. The latter however hinted at a breach of privacy. The rumours also sparked off toxic fights between BTS fans and Blackpink stans on social media. Jennie Kim's dating history was dissected, and even GD Dragon, Jimin and Bang PD names were dragged into the whole mess The whole thing does not look like it will end soon. Of late, there are many tweets from rival fans blatantly body-shaming the two idols. As we know, Kim Taehyung aka BTS V is hailed as one of the world's Most Handsome Men while Jennie Kim of Blackpink is termed as desirable by many magazine and polls. Both are music superstars and global icons in their own right. It looks like the whole thing started after Jennie Kim's latest advertisement pics that got millions of likes. She was seen posing in Calvin Klein underwear. Take a look at the tweets Well, some ARMYs are clearly not impressed. As we know, body-shaming can be very damaging. The K-Pop scene is under a lot of scrutiny for how skinny most of the idols are. Genuine music fans told people to focus on the songs instead of going there We can see that the comments are quite disparaging. Blackpink and Jennie Kim are now in the US while Kim Taehyung of BTS is planning on his debut album. He might also travel to Mexico for a variety show as per rumours",2022-11-13T08:00:00Z,1,1

It seems he has made up his mind to go at the earliest. The Bangtan Boys are looking at coming together and working as a group from mid 2025. It seems Jungkook will be the last one to go. He has been working on a solo album. Now, fans are coping up with this separation news in varied ways. Many have been very critical of the South Korean Government for not acknowledging the efforts of the boy band in promoting the nation's culture In the mean time, some Korean fans are worried that Jungkook being the adventurous man he is, might decide to join the Navy, marines or Airforce. The tenure there is longer. They have been writing small notes on social media for Jungkook to make him promise that he will only stick to the Army and be back. It looks like Jin, RM, JHope and SUGA are now only eligible for the ARMY and not combat missions. But K-ARMYs are worried about Jungkook who might want to challenge himself. Take a look at the tweets This is not all. It means people are buying purple rubber sandals too. In Korea, women wear white rubber sandals in the period when their partners are away for military enlistment.

Others said maybe students made a mistake discussing BTS in online class but this kind of behaviour was uncalled for.

THROWBACK: When BTS leader RM got candid about the ‘pressure’ of representing South Korea globally ,"We are looking back at December 2021, when BTS alum and leader RM spoke to Vogue Korea about some of the biggest concerns in his life! Reflecting on how his life has changed since debuting with the Bangtan Boys in 2013, RM looked back at their initial music and compared to their newer ones, he said: “[This music] was heartfelt at the time, but trends change quickly, and I realized that my own ear [for music] has changed quite a bit  Will ‘Butter‘ and ‘Permission to Dance‘ also sound outdated once time has passed? Because we live within trends, I’ve gotten used to [going along with what’s fashionable at the time], but I don’t think I should live like that  I’m not sure what to do, but I want to produce something ‘long-lasting’ and ‘timeless ’ Now that it’s been been nearly nine years since I debuted as BTS, I’ve started thinking about that a lot ”RM also shared: “In the past, I used to have a lot of rules in my head, like ‘You need to do this or that,’ and I was caught up in the idea of wanting to show off something amazing, such as an impressive technique  These days, I focus on trying to create a certain texture that I want to convey in an abstract way  I’ve developed the ability to think in multisensory dimensions, such as vision or touch  When you create music, there are different elements like lyrics, melody, beat, and voice, and my approach is to look at the sum of all these things together to see if they express what I originally wanted to convey ”Considering BTS’ popularity and representing South Korea in front of a global audience, the idol was asked if the responsibility is ever limits the band artistically or while making music  RM responded: “At times, representing the nation feels great, and at other times, it can be a lot of pressure  What’s certain is that this role isn’t something we achieved because we sought it out, and it’s not something that goes away just because you want it to  I think it’s my fate to accept it as my calling and do a good job at what I can  If I had to put it into words, I’d say that I’d like to live my life while thinking, ‘This kind of life is fun too '”ALSO READ: Will you debut as the eighth member of BTS?",2022-02-04T08:00:00Z,3,13
"BTS: RM being the father of Bangtan Boys is the most adorable thing ever; ARMY, here's an UNMISSABLE compilation video [WATCH]","Is BTS really on a hiatus? Well, hiatus or not, there's no dearth of content featuring the Bangtan Boys – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook. We would be getting some amazing solo content from BTS members soon RM aka Kim Namjoon is the leader of BTS, Bangtan Sonyeodan. He has been in charge of keeping together the other six members and maintaining harmony and leading the pack. And while doing so, Joonie aka RM turned from Rap Moster to RM (Real Me), father-figure types. From Namjoon comforting a crying Taehyung to being concerned about Jungkook and Jimin sleeping on the floor. From giving piggyback rides to J-Hope to helping the eldest child - Jin - whenever he is stuck. From collecting the members for a hug to cheering on the members being cute and adorable. And also being strict with the boys when they get out of hand, especially the maknae line - Park Jimin aka Jimin, Kim Taehyung aka V and Jeon Jungkook aka Jungkook. Despite RM not being the eldest member, he has turned into someone the Bangtan Boys rely on and look up to on various things. RM lets the boys be themselves and accepts all their shenanigans like a resigned father. Well, it is very funny and goofy. Who knew RM's dream of being a dad would come true in this way? Teehee, just kidding Meanwhile, RM is not new to solo projects. He has dropped two mixtapes of his own RM (2015) and Mono (2018) which were widely acclaimed. Mono had peaked at 26 on Billboard 200 which was the highest-charting album by a Korean soloist in chart history. BTS RM aka Kim Namjoon has collaborated with various artists such as Wale, Younha, Warren G, Gaeko, Krizz Kaliko, MFBTY, Fall Out Boy, Primary, and Lil Nas X to name a few. He has a KOMCA credit score of 199. He is gearing up for his solo album next and hopes that he is the one to release his solo project after J-Hope",2022-07-29T07:00:00Z,1,13

BTS: South Korea's defence minister says the K-Pop band can perform at global concerts even during enlistment [Read Report],"BTS and military enlistment has been a burning topic. The boys announced that they are on a group hiatus and would continue with solo activities for a while. Many felt this was because of the impending military enlistment. Now, South Korea's defence minister Lee Jong-sup has dropped a statement, which is quite interesting. He has said that the boys can perform at global concerts in their enlistment period. The minister made this comment on Monday in the middle of a debate on whether military service for K-Pop stars should be shortened to three weeks. As of now, the period is close to two years. In South Korea, every able-bodied male in the age group of 18-28 must join the South Korean army In December, Kim Seokjin aka Jin who is the eldest of the BTS boys will turn 30. He has to enlist in the military by January 2023. Before that, the boys will perform at the global concert in Busan which is a promotional bid for the World Expo in 2030. Since 2019, there is a revision due to which popstars can defer military service till the age of 30. As we know, military service is a must as the country has threat from North Korea, which is one of the top five nuclear powers in the world. Only few people have got exemptions or the chance to do a shorter service. They include Olympics and Asian Games medal winners and some classical musicians-dancer who win at prestigious international competitions like Chopin Piano Competition The Parliament is debating if a bill can be passed to shorten military service of K-Pop stars. The music industry rakes in billions for the economy in a year, and BTS is the biggest income generator. The pool of personnel resources in South Korea is decreasing due to low birth rates. This is due to a number of reasons ranging from cost of living to unwillingness of citizens to have babies Now, Big Hit Music has not commented on this statement made by the Minister. He was quoted as saying in the Korean media, ""Even if they join the military, there would be a way to give them a chance to practise and perform together if there are scheduled concerts abroad. As many people highly value (artists serving) in the military, that may help boost their popularity even more."" In April 2021, an official said that this uncertainly over military enlistment had caused mental stress to the Bangtan Boys. They are now doing solo work. We saw J-Hope's solo album and his performance at Lollapalooza in Chicago, which was a huge success This news item has left BTS ARMY with mixed reactions. One of them commented on Twitter, ""Like ""you got to do your military service and also work at the same time, because we want you to serve the military but don't want to lose the money that you bring to our country's economy. We don't care if you die of exhaustion as long as you bring us money and done your srvice"", while someone else wrote, ""Wowww. This is this INSANELY SELFISH. They want them to be burned out of exhaustion for doing two things - mandatory military service and work - concerts which are both phyiscally and mentally exhausting. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!!!"" Bangtan Boys are seen globally as the pride of Korea.

EXCLUSIVE: ASTRO’s Cha Eun Woo talks about bruising himself while working on K-drama Island,"K-pop idol Cha Eun Woo has put everything and more into his role for the fantasy action K-drama &#39;Island&#39; which began airing a couple of weeks ago  His acting which has been under review, all because of the typically stoic boy portrayals he received previously, gives way for people to notice just how much he has grown since the college ridden love stories where he was penned as just the handsome one or the lonely Prince on the lookout for his rightful place  In all those roles it seemed as if he was always finding ways to fit in, never fully accepting his surroundings and seeking familiarity 

In &#39;Island&#39;, Cha Eun Woo, snatches the plot right from the start to make it his own  He injects himself into the story as if embracing it with his whole might, and though the 25 year old plays five years younger, he makes it believable thanks to the mischief in his eyes and the sheer gut to challenge what could possibly kill him, all at the drop of a hat  Speaking in Italian, fans would make note of his increased hotness quotient while we can notice the efforts from the actor who seems to have gone all in 

What is the story of Island?

&#39;Island&#39; is a webtoon inspired K-drama brought to life thanks to a statement making ensemble, fairly impressive VFX and an immersive storyline  Here, the chaebol daughter of the famed Daeho group, Won Mi Ho, is sent off to Jeju Island for repenting for her actions  She encounters bloodthirsty demons on her way who she is unable to fight  A man intervenes with his dagger, hawk-like eyes, unbelievable speed and the urge to kill  Found to be Van, the suited man is tight-lipped and only appears when Won Mi Ho is in need of his help  As the old prophecy awakens and lust demons threaten to kill the unaware woman, a Priest named Yohan becomes curious about the happenings in South Korea and decides to return 

Introduction to Cha Eun Woo in Island as Priest Yohan

As he is initially introduced, Giovanni is a young boy named Kang Chan Hyeok who moved to Italy in his earlier days and returned at the age of 20 after being called upon by the pull of a prophecy  Here, he makes himself known as Priest Yohan, a popular Priest who has moved around saving humans from the wrath of spirits  His methods are none the ordinary as he channels his love for Hallyu aka the Korean wave while dealing with evil  While it may sound funny, it adds the necessary edge to Cha Eun Woo&#39;s character &nbsp;
With a pair of headphones around his ears, RnB music blasting through it, he uses ignorance to fend off the evil  Ruthless, he charges ahead while chanting and using a crucifix to burn through the negative energies  With sneakers on his feet and a spring in his step, he manages to surprise you with each action &nbsp;

The latest episode of &#39;Island&#39; saw Yohan bring out a pointed sword-like object and use it against Van, the character played by Kim Nam Gil, who is a half-human and half-demonic presence among them, managing to hide from everyone but the Priest who is out for his blood  The chemistry between Cha Eun Woo and Kim Nam Gil as they bicker, waiting to break out into a fight any moment, is better than we expected &nbsp;

Cha Eun Woo preparing for the role of Yohan

In an exclusive chat with Pinkvilla, the ASTRO member digs deep into his preparation for the character of Priest Yohan  He mentions going to cathedrals and meeting up with real-life Priests to learn the know-how of his role  On being asked what training he received, Cha Eun Woo opened up saying, &ldquo;While playing the role of a priest named Yohan, I had to take Italian or Greek and Latin lessons since I had such scenes  I went to a cathedral to see a priest and learned about the basics of Catholicism  Whenever I speak, I wanted it to be more Yohan-like, I worked on it so it could be more fitting to the role &ldquo;

On the other hand, since he is known for performing exorcisms, Cha Eun Woo&rsquo;s character takes on action scenes frequently and the actor worked on them with just as much enthusiasm, getting bruised while pulling them off with all his might  He spoke about the difficulties of working on the sets, &ldquo;I used my body a lot  When I was rolling over a mountain or something like that, I got some small scars and it hurt a little  I have some wounds and those bits were difficult but, I feel proud and it was fun portraying the character &rdquo;

Here&rsquo;s a funny interaction between Cha Eun Woo and Kim Nam Gil in our full interview with the &lsquo;Island&rsquo; cast:

TXT drops a bombshell first look at The Name Chapter: TEMPTATION; 5 things to expect from this comeback,"TOMORROW X TOGETHER has established itself as one of the frontrunners of this generation&rsquo;s K-pop music thanks to their genre-hopping music and a total takeover of today&rsquo;s style  Their songs have always impressed the audiences, having become longtime favourites of the MOAs who always chip in, in large numbers, expressing their surprise and admiration at every chance that they get at the sincere and fabulous music 

Now, returning with their fifth Korean EP, TOMORROW X TOGETHER is coming back to the music scene after a world tour and performances at music festivals, New Year&rsquo;s special stages, and more  After teasing their fans about the album for months now, the group finally announced their next EP after 8 months, following the release of their fourth mini-album &lsquo;Minisode 2: Thursday&#39;s Child&rsquo; in May 2022, on December 15 at midnight KST  It was revealed that their next series will begin with &lsquo;The Name Chapter: TEMPTATION&rsquo;  It continues from the conclusion of their earlier two series, namely, &lsquo;The Dream Chapter&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Chaos Chapter&rsquo; 

The Name Chapter: TEMPTATION

To be made available in total three versions, Daydream, Nightmare and Farewell, the upcoming schedule ahead of the album drop was teased  Starting from January 9 to the day after the release on January 28, the plan was revealed to the fans, with a &lsquo;Lullaby&rsquo; concept photo version set to be unveiled on January 15 at midnight KST  The promotion scheduler introduced the mysterious concept for this album which was followed by a concept teaser which said, &ldquo;The devil&rsquo;s voice that I encountered by the window of midnight was sweet &rdquo; It was accompanied by an eerie video of a silhouette and a butterfly, giving hints about the comeback &nbsp;

The mood teaser that followed was a peek into the wild ride that awaits at the end of the pre-release promotions 
https://twitter com/BIGHIT_MUSIC/status/1612011232898486272TXT&rsquo;s first concept photos

The first set of concept photos for the quintet&rsquo;s upcoming mini album &lsquo;The Name Chapter: TEMPTATION&rsquo;, was released on January 9  Titled &lsquo;Daydream&rsquo;, they stayed true to the concept as the fans collectively let out a shriek of surprise looking at the dream-like photos  Playing right into the theme of &lsquo;temptation&rsquo; the younger twenty year olds, seemed to be ready to show more skin this time around  With loose-fitting unbuttoned jackets, barely covering their torsos, these concept photos were nothing like what the fans have seen before  Barefooted and with light makeup, they seemed to be becoming one with nature  Fans appreciated the sculpted bodies of the five boys and trended hashtags like &lsquo;CALM DOWN&rsquo; on social media, expressing their astonishment 
https://twitter com/BIGHIT_MUSIC/status/1612101833115467776Looking at the introduction to the upcoming album, here&rsquo;s what we can expect from it 

TXT&rsquo;s bare bodies

We&rsquo;re sure the fans are not complaining but it seems that there will be a lot of shirtless or barely-there outfits in this comeback  The first set of concept photos is enough to hint  The adolescent boys who were once in colourful outfits singing about their crowns have grown and matured enough to scream about their lost love and now turn to something completely different  Maybe they&rsquo;ll be calmer this time around? More reserved? We can only wait to find out 

Unbelievable visuals

Not that we had any doubt before this, but the few photos we have seen so far of the five members of the group have once again instilled our belief about their flawless visuals  With light makeup or rock looks, their fit and tall frames in the latest, trendy and expensive wear or even in the most simple outfits, TOMORROW X TOGETHER&rsquo;s members can pull it off and look top-notch at the same time 

Exceptional choreography

This one&rsquo;s a no-brainer  Essentially creating a world full of some of the most followed and loved dance sequences over and over again, the synchronised and visually pleasing moves of Soobin, Yeonjun, Beomgyu, Taehyun and Huening Kai make it all the more exciting to wait for their releases  Fierce moves, stunts and dance breaks make for the group&rsquo;s viral sets with each song  Every time, they add fun elements to their choreographies to make it unique and we hope this time&rsquo;s no different 

Live vocals

Over time, TOMORROW X TOGETHER has made one thing very clear- they can sing, and that too very beautifully  Remember Yeonjun&rsquo;s Lonely Boy live rap? A moment that will forever be etched into the memory of not just fans but any viewers of the clip, the boy group always returns with tracks that heavily rely on their singing abilities 

A superhit album

When there are so many success-prone elements going into the making of these well-tailored music releases, the K-pop all-rounders may as well be ready for another hit album to add to their satchel  The first look has already raked in thousands of pre-orders across the world and it is only bound to grow in huge numbers henceforth 

We&rsquo;re looking forward to the release of TOMORROW X TOGETHER&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Name Chapter: TEMPTATION&rsquo; on January 27 at 2 pm KST

Na Young Seok PD who is known to have been the mastermind behind multiple popular Korean variety shows including &lsquo;2 Days &amp; 1 Night&rsquo;, &lsquo;New Journey to the West&rsquo;, &lsquo;Three Meals a Day&rsquo; as well as &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo; as well as its earlier spin-off show &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo;, is said to be returning for this season of &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; 

Seojin&rsquo;s premiere date

Earlier today, it was reported by Korean media outlets that the new restaurant variety show is in its last phase of post-production  They are said to be eyeing an early February date for the broadcast  While nothing has been confirmed, it is reported that the show will air every Friday  While the two seasons of &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo; spanned over 9 and 11 episodes each, &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo; had 12 episodes  A similar timeline is expected for &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; 

Cast for Seojin&rsquo;s

It was confirmed that the cast lineup for &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; would include actor Lee Seo Jin, actress Jung Yu Mi, best friends and former &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo; cast mates Park Seo Joon and Choi Woo Shik  This time, however, they will be joined by another member of the famed Wooga Squad  BTS&rsquo; V has reportedly been roped in to join the cast for this spin-off show  With such a sparkling team at its disposal, &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; may as well become one of the biggest and most anticipated variety show releases of the year 

Take a look at the reasons why &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; is set on the path to success 

The concept of Seojin&rsquo;s

It is known that unlike &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo; which looked to promote Korean dishes through its program, this spin-off will also include lighter options for the global audience  Earlier, it was reported that the show has been shot in Mexico this season following the international filming locations of Indonesia and Spain for &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo;, followed by a domestic shoot in Jeonnam in 2020 for &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo; 

Na PD&rsquo;s charm

A popular name in the industry, Na Young Seok PD is known to be level-headed and strict when it comes to conducting variety shows  He is hardly ever swayed by the charm of the cast before him and sticks to rules  At the same time, he creates amazingly enjoyable shows which receive great viewership ratings by adding fun segments, dire situations and unbelievable twists  &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; is expected to bring his magic to the table 

Popular participants

Actor Lee Seo Jin who has been present for both the seasons of &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo; and one season of &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo; is familiar with the overarching concept  It was observed that he was of great help during those shows and brings experience as well as leadership to the show  Turning it to focus on him after Youn Yuh Jung&rsquo;s decision to depart may become a successful change if he manages to pull off the role  Much like Lee Seo Jin, Jung Yu Mi has also been a part of the earlier three seasons and brings her own understanding to the show &nbsp;

Actors Park Seo Joon and Choi Woo Shik are best friends off-camera and jokesters on camera  They have a tried and tested chemistry which was previously seen in &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo;, &lsquo;Summer Vacation&rsquo;, &lsquo;Parasite&rsquo; and &lsquo;IN THE SOOP: Friendcation&rsquo;  This time the two will be joined by BTS member V who was seen leaving for Mexico as well as spotted alongside Park Seo Joon during a restaurant visit there  The K-pop icon confirmed his participation in the show by sharing a photo from the shoot where he could be seen staring at the bright moon with a shirt with actor Lee Seo Jin&rsquo;s caricature 
V for Victory

While BTS member V is known to not have a lot of skills in cooking, as previously seen during the group&rsquo;s activities including his memorable &lsquo;squirrel plate&rsquo; incident in &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo;, he brings charm wherever he goes  A certified &lsquo;social butterfly&rsquo; his synergy with the other cast members will be looked out for  He goes into &lsquo;maknae mode&rsquo; around his hyungs Park Seo Joon and Choi Woo Shik which was very visible throughout &lsquo;IN THE SOOP: Friendcation&rsquo; and so it will be interesting to see him back with them, though this time actor Park Hyung Sik and singer Peakboy will not be present

"BTS: Jungkook, V, SUGA, Jin - Ahead of Valentine's Day let us take a look at JUST how romantic the Bangtan Boys are","BTS and ARMY share a loving bond. On the occasion of Valentine’s Day, ARMYs go into the imagination mood. Well, many of them are in that frame of mind 365 days a year but V-Day further amplifies the feelings. BTS members RM, SUGA, Jimin, Jin, Jungkook, J-Hope or V rarely discuss their private lives or what they feel about love or romance. However, BTS ARMY can imagine what kind of boyfriends they did be or perhaps what would turn them in partners. In fact, some members like SUGA, Jin and Jungkook have said some truly romantic things in front of BTS ARMY that made hearts mushy. BTS leader RM can tease fans, that too in the most sophisticated of manner. And what would we say about Jimin and V. Many fans feel that Kim Taehyung is the God Of Romance and Seduction in BTS while Jimin is the lover who has a heart full of warmth. Just ahead of Valentine’s Day 2022, let us see the romantic quotient of the Bangtan Boys… BTS maknae Jeon Jungkook is quite a romantic. He once said he did do anything for the girl he loves. Jungkook also made fans feel mushy when he said he did like to recreate the epic kissing scene from the movie Love 911. This proves that he is quite a romantic at heart BTS member J-Hope has a passion for dance and keeping others happy. Jung Hoseok or Hobi is perceptive, hard-working and caring. ARMYs felt very sad when he revealed that he was dumped by his girlfriend in school. J-Hope loves romantic shows as they inspire his lyric-writing. He said he dreams of finding true love like the one seen on Crash Landing On You. Isn’t that too romantic? ARMYs can dream of that one epic love story knowing this fact about Hobi In an old video, BTS Jin has spoken about how he dreams of cooking food with his partner when he has one. In fact, he said that his food got burnt at times as he was too deep in the thought. If food is your language of love, then Kim Seokjin is your perfect Valentine’s Day date. He can make you a great meal, tell you dad jokes and go the extra mile to have you roll on the floor with laughter. BTS Jin is quite traditional in his ideals of love BTS rapper, music producer and songwriter SUGA is on a high. Old BTS ARMYs know that Min Yoongi has a way with words. He told fans to keep their fourth finger empty (for the marriage ring), and coolly asked for the documents when someone proposed to him. SUGA is always flooded with marriage proposals and why not. Min Yoongi can sing, play instruments, write you a song, prepare a nice meal and even take you for a long drive (he has a grade one driving license). SUGA has written some of the most romantic notes for fans some of which are part of old BTS archives. The letter written for his former girlfriend is a reflection of how he feels about relationships and love BTS front-man RM is admired by millions. A skilled rapper, composer, music producer and songwriter RM is the complete package. He can also be a tease if he wants to. Remember what he said to husbands of ARMYs on the Zoom pyjama party. Fans dream that a date with RM would mean a walk through a museum enjoying art or soaking in the sights of nature. He is a man who loves all the finer things of life. Though he has not spoken about his romantic side, ARMYs only imagine how life would be with a man as hot and intelligent as Kim Namjoon. He is the perfect Valentine’s Day date for all sapiosexuals BTS member V is known for his good looks, charisma and deep baritone. Whether it is Sweet Night from Itaewon Class or Christmas Tree from Our Beloved Summer, he is someone who has given some truly romantic OSTs. In fact, his video from Hawaii where he was singing Travel With Me while driving a Mustang conjured up images in the minds of ARMY on how romantic Kim Taehyung could be as a partner. From sharing pics of starlit skies to setting up thirst traps at 3 am posing shirtless, BTS V is known as the God of Seduction BTS Jimin is full of love, warmth and compassion. Jimin once said he wanted to meet the parents of ARMYs for giving birth to such loving fans. He is also someone to reach out with empathy and kindness. His recent note for a fan is proof. If you love kindness is a man, he is your perfect guy",2022-02-13T08:00:00Z,1,8

https://twitter com/THEBLACKLABEL/status/1612313341245931523Here are 5 reasons VIBE could be the next viral song

1  Taeyang&rsquo;s first new song in six years as a solo artist

The release of the song &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo; will mark Taeyang&rsquo;s first new release as a solo artist in about six years  His last work as a solo artist was a record named &lsquo;White Night&rsquo; which was released in 2017  The record included two new singles, &lsquo;Tonight&rsquo; and &lsquo;Darling&rsquo;  Additionally, this new song will also be released under his new label THEBLACKLABEL after the expiration of his contract with YG Entertainment  However, it is an affiliate company of YG Entertainment, which producer Teddy heads 

However, for Jimin, the song will mark his first venture into solo music much like the other BTS members who are currently focusing on their solo careers  Earlier J-Hope debuted as a soloist in 2022 with the album &lsquo;Jack In The Box&rsquo; and Jin debuted with his solo single &lsquo;The Astronaut&rsquo; in October 2022  After that, RM released his solo album &lsquo;Indigo&rsquo; in December 2022 and Jungkook also released his solo song &lsquo;Dreamers&rsquo; as an official soundtrack for FIFA World Cup 2022 

2  Taeyang and Jimin&rsquo;s aesthetics on the poster

On January 4 2023, THEBLACKLABEL made an official announcement through Taeyang&#39;s social media accounts, including both the release date and title of the song  Taeyang also shared an additional solo teaser of the song which will feature Jimin, in a monochromatic headshot style  A second teaser revealed Taeyang in a sleek and chiselled look 

The poster released shows the perfect mixture of groove and hip-hop with both the idols in sleek hairstyles and black outfits  Even before the official announcement of &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo; was made, fans were already suspicious about this collaboration  When Taeyang posted some behind-the-scenes pictures from the recording studio with another person  Fans were quick to identify the musician as Jimin and as J-Hope liked the picture, it further fueled the collaboration rumours 
https://twitter com/THEBLACKLABEL/status/16127059270224977933  Fans&#39; reaction to the teaser

THEBLACKLABEL, Taeyang&rsquo;s agency also confirmed the collaboration of the two K-pop idols by sharing the first teaser of the song  Jimin and Taeyang absolutely depict a different vibe in this teaser with powerful synergy and fierce gazes  The teaser itself has garnered huge attention from fans on a global scale  It will undoubtedly become a viral song 

Earlier fans went into a frenzy as it was announced that BIGBANG&rsquo;s Taeyang will be collaborating with BTS&rsquo; Jimin  BTS&#39; official account made this announcement on Twitter along with sharing an official poster featuring both Taeyang and Jimin in red and black outfits 

Fans are increasingly happy for Jimin as he is collaborating with his musical inspiration  One user tweeted that the dream did come true for Jimin and that he is an inspiration to millions of other people &nbsp;

4  Combined abilities of Taeyang and Jimin

The song combines the musical abilities of both Jimin from BTS and Taeyang from BIGBANG  Both these K-pop idols are well-liked by the audience because of their talents and looks  Taeyang&rsquo;s groovy music is expected to harmoniously melt with the delicate and unique vocals of Jimin, which will certainly make this song a huge success 

This collaboration for the song &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo; is also extremely special for Jimin since he has always admired Taeyang  When Jimin was asked in an interview about the singer that he most admired and respected, he answered, &quot;Taeyang sunbaenim (senior) &quot;

5  Song&rsquo;s release on 13 January 2023

The release date of the &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo; is January 13, 2:00 PM KST, which is interesting as Jimin&rsquo;s birth date is October 13 while BTS debuted as a K-pop group in 2013  Netizens were quick to make the connection that 13 might be a lucky number for Jimin  His fans took to Twitter to express their excitement over the news  One user mentioned that this BTS singer is so cool while the other one mentions that two members of the two most popular K-Pop groups are coming together so everyone should come together to make it successful 

Previously, Jimin from BTS also released OST &lsquo;With You&rsquo; in collaboration with the singer Ha Sung Woon for the Korean drama Our Blues  The song received a huge response from fans around the world with it ranking high on Billboard&rsquo;s Hot Trending Songs chart 

Jimin made his debut with BTS in 2013 along with six other members Jungkook, RM, V, Jin, J-Hope, and SUGA  Earlier, he also released three other solo tracks along with BTS that included &lsquo;Filter&rsquo;, &lsquo;Serendipity&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Lie&rsquo;  On the other hand, Taeyang made his debut with BIGBANG in 2006 with Daesung, T O P , G-Dragon, and former member Seungri  The group made their increasingly awaited comeback in April 2022 after four long years with the track &lsquo;Still Life&rsquo;

BTS member Jin has a day out with Pokemon's Pikachu but it's J-Hope's comment that'll make you ROFL,"BTS' fame is such that there is no doubt that the K-Pop band is by far not only one of the most popular music groups in today's time, but also among the most iconic of all time, with Jin, J-Hope, Jimin, Jungkook, V, Suga and RM (those are the BTS members for the uninitiated) enjoying fame, fans and impact that cuts across every ethnic, cultural and geographical demographic known to us. So, it comes as no surprise that ARMY (that's what BTS fans the world over refer to themselves as) can't get enough of BTS and make it a point to keep up to date with every little development about the group So, if you consider yourself one amongst ARMY, then this latest BTS news should be right up your alley. For those of you who were quite worried about BTS’ oldest member Kim Seokjin aka Jin after he performed both at the Grammys and the group's Las Vegas tour, here's some good news. Jin seems to have completely recovered from his injury, with his cast also having come off as evidence in a bunch of pics the singer-songwriter recently posted on his official Instagram account.' While the first post has Jin posing with his arms outstretched surrounding by some buildings, it's his second IG post that has grabbed everyone's attention as he's spotted sitting between two large Pikachu (from the Pokemon series, for the uninitiated) soft toys and medium-sized Pokeball soft toy on his lap. However J-Hope's commenting, “You’re going around alone and doing cute stuff by yourself,” accompanied by a fire emoji is what's putting the icing on top of Jin's post J-Hope's comment is particularly amusing because Jin had earlier revealed he would keep asking him out for drinks while his bandmate seemed busy with other stuff, so this time, J-Hope's comment almost makes it seem like he was ready to go out for drinks, but Jin decided to enjoy himself solo – all in good jest though",2022-05-15T07:00:00Z,1,8

"BTS x Durga Puja 2022: Kolkata pandal plays Yet To Come; fan says, 'This is a very very rare occurrence' [Watch Video]","Kolkata fans of the K-Pop group BTS have an extra something to cheer about. A fan has shared a video where we can hear Yet To Come being played in full blast on a loudspeaker at a Durga Puja pandal. This is very unusual. Of course, the popularity of BTS has made inroads into India's hinterland. We showed you how Jungkook's photo was used by an English coaching institute in Haryana. His pic is also popular in the barber shops of small-town India. But having BTS songs played during what is seen as a religious and community occasion is quite unusual But then, Durga Puja is synonymous with music and dance. After every evening aarti, there is talent show or people bring musicians/artistes over for some dance, music, drama, recitation and what not. There is a concerted effort on part of Durga Puja pandals across the country to make kids aware of the heritage, culture and tradition behind the festival. This is a way to attract the youth. Moreover, maximum K-Pop fans in India come from the eastern part of the country. Take a look at the video The above video was played on the occasion of Mahasaptami which is devoted to the worship of Goddess Kalratri. She is one of the most fierce forms of the Goddess. Bengali BTS ARMYS have been wishing one another on social media. This is the time of the year when Bengalis rejoice their hearts out. For young people, it also means fave music Lucky fans can see the band in action at the Busan concert. They are practising really hard for the same. Namjoon informed that the dance practise has started. We wish BTS the best for the upcoming endeavour",2022-10-03T07:00:00Z,1,1
BTS ARMY slam radio station after host pokes fun at fans spamming him to play Jungkook and Charlie Puth's Left and Right,"BTS vocalist Jungkook and Charlie Puth gave us the song of the summer with the collab, Left and Right. It has been doing very well. It has been on the iTunes chart for 100 days. It was also nominated as Song of the Summer at the VMAs. Audacy gave Jungkook the award of being the Artist of the Summer. The song has been successful due to its peppy music and the hard work put in by fans of Charlie Puth and ARMY. The two bombarded radio stations with requests to play it which made sure it got good air-time. As we know, radio play determines how successful and popular artists will be in the US. Radio play is also crucial to get a song to chart on Billboard DJ Brian Grimes from iHeartRadio said he would not play Left and Right even though he claimed to be a fan of Charlie Puth. He had tweeted about the same. But he deleted it saying that some angry fans sent him death threats. But some ARMY have uploaded the video of Brian Grimes and other DJs mocking fans calling them ""BTS Nerds"" In the video, they can fans as BTS Nerds. One of them say if fans bombard them like this, then they would not play it. ARMY is not impressed with how the hosts calls ARMY as kids.

"Run BTS Next Top Genius Part 2 Highlights: Jungkook slips up about last episode, who wins in V versus Jimin?","The latest episode of BTS&rsquo; fun program was called &lsquo;Run BTS Next Top Genius&rsquo; and the second part of this edition had the fans of the group rolling on the floor with laughter and shedding tears at the same time  Here are the highlights from the episode as well as why the BTS ARMY may need tissues soon 

About Run BTS

South Korean boy group BTS began a show called &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; on the heels of their then-just-released track &lsquo;Run&rsquo; which started off into a basic introduction and has blossomed to become a high fan favourite weekly catch-up turned occasional show  From 2015 to taking a break in late 2021 and resuming with special episodes in 2022, the show has indeed come a long way  However, it may soon have to put brakes on the run 

Run BTS Next Top Genius Part 1 Recap

The first part of show&#39;s latest editionshow introduced the fans to tiny games involving the BTS members who played card games and were subjected to lie detection under the scrutiny of each other&rsquo;s eyes as some fun &lsquo;cat ears&rsquo; (electroencephalograph ones)  Even with not a lot at play, the BTS members ensured their hilarity was at its peak best and spread joy with their content  &lsquo;Run BTS Next Top Genius Part 2&rsquo; was teased with more screaming, laughter and games at the expense of the seven members 

The dice-y game

With a lot of points at stake, the BTS members played a long winding game of dice which required them to throw it and declare a digit making others guess if they were saying the truth  If they&rsquo;re caught, they move backwards, successful and they march right ahead  With Jungkook playing a dangerous game right from the start, the BTS members had the most fun teasing him about it as he kept going back to the start point  An honest player right from the get-go, SUGA was the first to pass through and made it past the end line in a swoop  The game turned calculative and funny at a point as some of the members including RM and Jimin kept going back and forth by continuously objecting to other people&rsquo;s declarations and poking fun at each other 

The Yes or No betrayal

The fourth game was one testing the loyalties of the BTS members as they all sent out signals to each other hoping for cooperation  They were all sent to a room to ask if they&rsquo;d like to split the points with all members and had to choose yes or no  Soon after, all seven of them secretly revealed their answers and the minority would determine the winners  In tthe &lsquo;95 liners, members V and Jimin, camewho came out on top as they each picked &lsquo;No&rsquo;  The two were the top two contenders for the finals, competing in an upcoming fierce match 

Rock, Paper and Scissors

The final game to decide the winner was laid out as the infamous &lsquo;Rock, Paper, Scissors&rsquo; which has become known for ensuring big battles in the world of K-pop  Also frequently used to decide on the most basic things, the game was played through cards and divided the team of BTS into two, with half on the side of V and the other half on Jimin&rsquo;s side  They each had three rounds to decide their 5 cards with rock, paper or scissors on them with advice from the other members  However, only the members themselves knew their original sides ensuing a lot of suspicion and chaos  While Jimin doubted those giving him suggestions, V dedicatedly followed all that was told to him  A last spurt of 10 seconds had them change up everything adding more havoc to the already crazy game  Finally, when the other members&rsquo; loyalties were revealed, SUGA managed to fool everyone by being at Jimin&rsquo;s side all the time and in fact belonging to V&rsquo;s team, meanwhile, J-Hope&rsquo;s changing alliances finally found a home with the other 1995 star &nbsp;

Jimin was announced as the final winner of this edition of &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; and was awarded a trophy and other funny elements that the other members were not in the least bit jealous about &nbsp;

Is Run BTS ending?

Jungkook made a fleeting comment towards the end of the episode as he said, &ldquo;Yes, like this  As of today, &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo;  It&rsquo;s ending &rdquo; making the rest of the six laugh in shock as they stopped him  They confirmed that one more episode was left to shoot  The captions confirmed that another filming schedule for &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; before Jin&rsquo;s enlistment, the last one for a while, has indeed been planned &nbsp;

While it may not mean that the show is coming to an end, it is indeed true that Jin may not be a part of the other upcoming &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; episodes if the group decides to continue shooting after his enlistment which took place on December 13, though highly unlikely  This means that after another edition, &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; may end up taking another break (if they&rsquo;ve not shot for more than one episode after this) until the military services of all other members are also complete and they reconvene sometime in 2025 as previously revealed

BTS: A drunk Jin at Jungkook's birthday forgets J-Hope's name; check how amused Army reacted,"BTS member Jungkook celebrated his 25th birthday yesterday. And the young handsome man conducted a live session with the BTS ARMY and had a fun Karaoke/ acapella concert session online. Jungkook sang songs as he always does and answered a few questions, honoured ARMY's song request. He was drinking as well, it seems. And it's really unlikely and rare when BTS members don't make an appearance in other BTS members' live. And that's what happened last night. BTS' eldest member, Kim Seokjin aka Jin, made an appearance. Jin was a little drunk. Jin and Jungkook's interaction during the VLive won a lot of hearts Jin made a surprise appearance at Jungkook's birthday party. He popped up from behind the kitchen counter where he had been hidden until Jungkook started his LIVE. Jin gifted grapes to Jungkook and added that he is not promoting the grapes from his uncle's farm and was just passing by to give them all to the members. Jin then proclaimed that he has changed his mind since it was late. He shared that Jungkook was the second member he visited. BTS' eldest member Kim Seokjin was very talkative as usual. But this time, he was also a little drunk When Jin shared that he has had one glass of drink, Jungkook exposed him that he has had two glasses. Later, Jin made Jungkook pretend that he brought the cake. Jin had intended to bring the cake but since it was too late night in night and all the cake shops were closed for the day. A little tipsy Jin wholeheartedly sang the birthday song for Jungkook who also pretended to be very much surprised Jungkook's birthday VLive is one of the biggest trends in Hollywood News. ARMY thought that Jungkook would come online the night before and begin his birthday with them. But there was no update on it. But Jungkook conducted the live late in the night right before his birthday ended. Jin's short but a surprise visit was quite goofy and adorable and it won a lot of hearts. Jin thought that he'd be the only member who would come and greet Junkook on his birthday but he was stumped twice when Jungkook revealed that Jimin had dropped by. Jin started taking the names of every BTS member and missed out on J-Hope's name and took Jungkook's name instead. It was one adorable moment of Jin from the live. J-Hope and Jimin, both, had dropped by in person to wish Jungkook apart from Jin.

BTS' RM and Jungkook will attend the 2023 Grammys? Here's why it's payback time for the K-pop group,"The official account of the Grammys recently started following the two members of BTS, which includes RM and Jungkook, on Instagram  There has been increasing speculation amongst ARMY and others about why the Grammys started following only two out of the seven members of the boy band group  Rumors are going around that Namjoon and Jungkook from BTS might attend the 2023 Grammys award ceremony &nbsp;

Rumors of RM and Jungkook attending 2023 Grammys&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now, there have been rumors that BTS leader RM aka Namjoon and Jungkook will be soon travelling together to attend the 2023 Grammys  RM is expected to be representing BTS at this year&#39;s awards ceremony while Jungkook&rsquo;s attendance is under question  BTS has created history by being nominated for three categories for the 2023 Grammy Awards  These include Best Music Video for &lsquo;Yet To Come&rsquo;, Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for the collaboration track &lsquo;My Universe&rsquo; along with Coldplay, and Album of the Year for Coldplay&rsquo;s &lsquo;Music of the Spheres&rsquo;  This is the third consecutive year in which BTS has been nominated for the Grammy Awards 

Even though ARMY have a love-and-hate relationship with the Academy awards, they feel that BTS should definitely gain their due recognition in the music industry  While official sources have not yet confirmed all this, fans are very excited to see their idols from the biggest K-pop group in the prestigious ceremony  The fans quickly took to Twitter to express their happiness with the trending hashtag &rsquo;BTS Paved The Way&rsquo; on Twitter 

BTS members have yet to react to nominations or rumors of RM and Jungkook travelling to the U S A  for the award ceremony  However, RM did share an Instagram story over the announcement video along with tagging Coldplay in November 2022 following the revelation of the nominations 

Did the Grammys purposefully snub BTS last year?

When BTS released their first ever English title track &lsquo;Dynamite&rsquo; in 2020, it broke several long-standing records on multiple platforms including breaking the record of most views on YouTube within 24 hours, ranking in the Billboard Hot 100 Chart for consecutive thirty-two weeks, reaching 100 iTunes No 1s in just eight hours, ranking first on Global Top 50 chart on Spotify&rsquo;s daily, along with breaking two Guinness World Records  The release of &lsquo;Dynamite&rsquo; further earned BTS their first Grammy nomination in 2021  With these incredible achievements of BTS&rsquo; &lsquo;Dynamite&rsquo;, it was consistently questioned why this K-pop group ended up being mere nominees and not the winner of the award 

This was also repeated last year when BTS was nominated for the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for &lsquo;Butter&rsquo;  They lost this award to Doja Cat and SZA&#39;s song &lsquo;Kiss Me More&rsquo;  The seven members of BTS not only made a distinctive entrance to the awards ceremony, but they also completely wowed the audience with their smashing performance while even bringing in Olivia Rodrigo for a cameo 

Fans&rsquo; reaction to BTS not winning Grammys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The K-pop community and massive fan following of BTS were left fuming with the Grammys for snubbing BTS for the second consecutive year  Since then, the tag #Scammys has been making rounds on the internet  ARMY, BTS&rsquo; followers accused the Academy of using the popularity of the K-pop brand to scoop up the increased viewership counts for the award ceremony  Grammys&rsquo; use of endless BTS promotions and performance teasers further did not help their case 

One user tweeted that even though they are happy for Doja Cat to win the award, the decision is extremely unfair as the Grammys have snubbed the biggest pop songs for two consecutive years  While other fans simply tweeted that even though BTS has not won a Grammy, they are still the real winners  ARMY even started questioning the credibility of the show 

This controversy further fueled several allegations of xenophobia and racism considering the previous track record of the Grammys  Users noted that throughout the years there has been a lack of diversity and differential treatment of artists of colour  BTS fans were quick to talk on their socials accounts that not winning Grammys does not make one of the best K-pop groups any less valuable 

BTS has certainly made a huge impact on the music industry  There is not only the K-pop group&#39;s best commercial success, but they have also garnered a fan following of millions of people around the world  It is even interesting to note that from this Korean boy group, only RM is fluent in English and yet they have resonated with people around the globe, breaking any language barriers

"Dating rumours grip K-pop world: NCT’s Taeyong and Park Ju Hyun, SEVENTEEN's Vernon and TXT’s stylist?","Just a day ago, BIGBANG member G-Dragon&rsquo;s agency YG Entertainment, denied the rumours running rife about his relationship with Shinsegae Group&rsquo;s chairwoman Lee Myung Hee&rsquo;s granddaughter  The two went out with other friends as she is known to be acquainted with quite a few artists associated with the agency and she shared a photo enjoying her time at the Mnet survival show &lsquo;Street Man Fighter&rsquo; concert in Seoul  Soon as rumours of them dating were doing the rounds, the retail giant released a rare statement rubbishing them and asking to refrain from making speculations 

Now, another set of rumours involving a K-pop artist and a K-drama star began their course on the internet and once again their agencies have come out to clarify the same  Here&rsquo;s a roundup of slightly questionable and some downright funny dating rumours in the world of K-pop currently 

NCT&rsquo;s Taeyong and actress Park Ju Hyun

On January 12, an online community post caught the attention of netizens which claimed that NCT member Taeyong and actress Park Ju Hyun were dating  The post included the two artists&rsquo; liking for online gaming and a reference to the SuperM member&rsquo;s username  They also shared information about the &lsquo;Love All Play&rsquo; actor attending a recent NCT concert 

The poster claimed that Taeyong&rsquo;s gaming ID was &lsquo;Sorang-i&rsquo;, and they related it to Park Ju Hyun&rsquo;s character named Sorang in her currently ongoing MBC K-drama &lsquo;The Forbidden Marriage&rsquo;  Furthermore, the post spoke about Park Ju Hyun attending NCT 127&rsquo;s concert and being seated in the section reserved for family members, feeding the rumours &nbsp;

Park Ju Hyun&rsquo;s agency, 935 Entertainment, has responded to this by saying that &ldquo;Actress Park Ju Hyun and NCT&rsquo;s Taeyong are just friends &rdquo; They clarified any confusion about her attending the concert by adding that she likes to attend shows of her favourite artists, and is known to posting photos from her visits  &ldquo;She personally attended IU&rsquo;s concert and shared a picture, and goes to various other concerts besides that [the NCT 127 concert], posting pictures from them &rdquo;

As for her online gaming, the source from her agency said that the actor enjoys games as a hobby, so much so that she has posted videos of her playing on her YouTube channel  They said that Park Ju Hyun and NCT&rsquo;s Taeyong are just buddies who like to play games together, and do not have anything further than that  The source added that the actress has a large group of friends who she keeps up with 

SM Entertainment, Taeyong&rsquo;s agency, reportedly gave a very brief response by calling the rumours false and reiterating that they are just friends 

SEVENTEEN&rsquo;s Vernon and a TXT staff member

Netizens claimed that SEVENTEEN member Vernon is dating a stylist from TOMORROW X TOGETHER&rsquo;s team  It was said that the staff member was recently asked if she was dating on her Instagram to which she replied with a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; over a photo of a teddy bear  Reportedly, a similar item was spotted being brought back by the SEVENTEEN member following the group&rsquo;s US tour  More similarities in their accessories which are being called as &ldquo;couple items&rdquo; were noted by netizens &nbsp;

There has been no response from SEVENTEEN&rsquo;s agency about the rumours and many are questioning the credibility of these claims &nbsp;

TXT&rsquo;s Yeonjun and LE SSERAFIM&rsquo;s Huh Yunjin

TOMORROW X TOGETHER&rsquo;s oldest member Yeonjun is known to be acquaintances with a lot of K-pop idols around the industry and often hangs out with them, building a big circle of friends  He also participates in dance challenges and one of his most loved ones are those with LE SSERAFIM&rsquo;s Kim Chaewon for the girl group&rsquo;s songs &lsquo;FEARLESS&rsquo; and &lsquo;ANTIFRAGILE&rsquo; 

Now rumours about him dating another LE SSERAFIM member are doing the rounds as netizens have reportedly found Huh Yunjin&rsquo;s Spotify account  The said account allegedly has the songs previously suggested by the K-pop idol and is named &lsquo;Yunny&rsquo; which goes around as Yunjin&rsquo;s nickname  The netizens are also claiming that Yunjin&rsquo;s sister&nbsp;reportedly follows the account 

The interesting bit comes in with the details that people have noticed as the made note of the profile photo which is reportedly a drawing of a girl and a boy, claimed to be Yeonjun and Yunjin  The picture in concern is drawing similarities to the LE SSERAFIM member&rsquo;s recent most solo release &lsquo;I&ne; DOLL&rsquo; which has an animated photo as its cover and the same animation throughout the music video  It is being said that the profile photo for the music account is of Yunjin sometime in September 2022 with the boy&rsquo;s drawing looking very similar to how Yeonjun looked at the same time  They have made connections to his greenish hairstyle and ear piercing  Another claim comes in the form of the idols&rsquo; appearance during the show &lsquo;The Game Caterers&rsquo; where the netizens spoke about them hanging around each other 

While the two are under the same parent label and could very well be friends, their respective agencies are yet to respond to the rumours

"Love for BTS: Missing teenage Pakistani girls found 1200 kms from home, ran away to meet favourite K-pop group","Last week, two Pakistani teenage girls were reported missing from their home in Korangi, Karachi city  Police discovered that these teenage girls were not kidnapped but rather ran away to meet their favourite K-pop musical sensation BTS  They had made plans to travel to South Korea and with an extensive search, police later found them in Lahore this week 

Here are more details about how these teenage girls ran away from their homes and how police found them 

Two teenage girls reported missing

As per the police report, two girls, aged 13 and 14, went missing from their home in Karachi on January 2, 2023  The older girl went to her younger friend&rsquo;s home and they both went outside for some time  However, they were nowhere to be found when their fathers went searching for the girls  The father assumed that the girls might have been kidnapped or gotten involved in a foul situation by unknown assailants  This is why the father reported a missing complaint for the thirteen year old daughter 

How did the police find the girls?

When police became involved, they started with a thorough search of the 13 year old girl and then they understood the teenage girls&#39; intention to flee to South Korea and meet their favourite K-pop group BTS  During this extensive police search, a diary was found of the 13 year old girl which revealed their plans 

Police stated to CNN in an interview that the diary included details such as train timetables and details of another friend of theirs who was also planning to run away with the two teenage girls  In this handwritten diary, they also prepared a plan to reach Islamabad by train  The police interviewed this other friend  They also claimed that the duo even wanted to take their relative Naufil with them but Naufil refused to take this plan 

A forensic examination was also conducted by the police for their deleted browsing data and WhatsApp chats, which further confirmed that they left their homes to go to South Korea and join the K-pop sensation BTS  The girls carried out thorough online research on South Korea, including things to do, types of clothes to wear, things to avoid, and so on  The duo Googled these things and made their plans accordingly 

After finding this information, the police aggressively started searching for the duo, whose location was traced to Lahore, which is 1200 kilometres from their home  The girls travelled to Lahore by train  The police in charge of the investigation later found that the two teenage girls were in police custody in Lahore 

The duo were found by a patrolling constable at a railway station  They seemed in miserable condition and were trying to disguise themselves as boys so they got overlooked  When the duo were initially probed, they complained about the indifferent attitude of their parents and wanted to live life on their own terms  The girls are in safe and sound condition as of now 

A cultural journalist who spoke to CNN about this case mentioned that the decisions and risks taken by girls were not so surprising since &lsquo;stans&rsquo; are known to do anything for their idols  This is why it is important to create a safe and organized space for fan girls so that they can freely engage with each other and talk about their favourite idols rather than taking the risk of fleeing from home 

The senior superintendent of Karachi said that they had made arrangements with the Lahore police to coordinate bringing these teenage girls back home  He further urged parents to monitor the online activities of their children in a video statement

BIGBANG’s Taeyang on working with BTS’ Jimin for VIBE: Like a hip-hop duo; Who gave collab idea and more,"On January 13  BIGBANG member Taeyang released his long-awaited comeback with a single named &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo; and the other thing making the music world go gaga over this release was the featuring artists  Taeyang had brought in BTS member Jimin to collaborate on this song and it soon took over the K-pop world in a frenzy  This amalgamation of Taeyang&rsquo;s long-adored vocals returning after 6 years and Jimin&rsquo;s charismatic presence venturing into his solo world, was one nobody expected but everyone celebrated soon after its announcement 

The question, however, remained: where did the thought of &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo; first begin? Who first approached whom and if any difficulties stood between them while working on the song  Taeyang held a countdown live broadcast an hour before dropping the song on THEBLACKLABEL&rsquo;s YouTube channel and delved into the details of this collaboration 

Taeyang spills about collaboration with Jimin

On being asked where did the idea of working with Jimin first stem from, the BIGBANG member recalled an incident on a casual night in THEBLACKLABEL studio after dinner, he was conversing with producer Teddy Park who is known for being the man behind a lot of BLACKPINK&rsquo;s superhit tracks like &lsquo;AS IF IT&#39;S YOUR LAST&rsquo;, &lsquo;DDU-DU DDU-DU&rsquo; and the girls solo tracks, and is also the co-founder of THEBLACKLABEL, which is Taeyang&rsquo;s new agency  While thinking about his upcoming projects including a solo album, the popular producer mentioned how fun it would be to have Taeyang and Jimin on one song  He added that if the two worked together, people would love it  This was also when BTS primarily did group activities and the members were not as active as solo artists &nbsp;

Teddy Park&rsquo;s words in passing were taken seriously by the 34 year-old as the thought stuck in his mind  While he had never pondered over the possibility before, the simple mention made him think of a great collaboration that would come to fruition a couple of years later 

How did Taeyang and Jimin meet?

BIGBANG and BTS are two supergroups that have made themselves known globally  The members each have a massive fan following  But unfortunately they&rsquo;ve never been spotted together previously, up until 2022 when they began attending similar events and going to the same parties  Taeyang seemed to be aware of this gap in their matching schedules as he mentioned how their promotional activities had never overlapped before  Moreover, the singer had also never asked anyone to collaborate with him before this and found it difficult to come across someone he&rsquo;d like to work with 

To his rescue, last year there were a few dinners that the BIGBANG member got invited to where he had an opportunity to meet BTS  Taeyang spoke about coming across the group&rsquo;s members one by one and eventually becoming acquainted with Jimin  Simple chats later, they ended up talking about working together some day and Taeyang asked Jimin if he&rsquo;d like for them to make music together which finally resulted in going to the studio and working on the track that is now called &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo; 

Taeyang and Jimin shooting for VIBE

The singer also spoke about working for other promotional bits like teaser photos at the music video filming site  He added that they tried to add an older feel to the song, making them feel like a hip hop duo 

Manoeuvring their different labels

Taeyang belonged to YG Entertainment when the creation of this song first began and has since moved to its subsidiary THEBLACKLABEL following the expiration of his exclusive contract in December 2022  On the other hand, BTS member Jimin is an artist with BIGHIT MUSIC, and overall to HYBE  Moreover, it is rare for the BIGBANG members to collaborate with someone, more so outside of their own agency  So, Taeyang spoke about having to work out that bit for the song and how he as well as Jimin wished to make a great song as well as the music video for &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo;  During a recent interview with Rolling Stone, the singer talked of the BTS member taking a lot of effort for this song, which he had come to appreciate greatly 

VIBE choreography

Taeyang and Jimin are known to be quick on their feet however the former had not worked on his dancing skills for quite some time now while the latter had a different style than what they were aiming for this song, which led the two of them to face some difficulties while learning the steps, making them wonder about the reason and if it was really a tough collection of steps

https://twitter com/NBAJPN/status/1613757478713556994https://twitter com/NBAJPN/status/1613723587923562498https://twitter com/BTS_twt/status/1613492849366151170Suchwita:

On January 5th, a video titled &quot;[Suchwita] EP 2 SUGA with Shin Dong Yeop&quot; was posted on the YouTube channel &#39;Bangtan TV&#39;  &#39;Suchwita&#39; is an abbreviation of &#39;time taken by SUGA,&#39; and is SUGA&rsquo;s personal content  Prior to the full-fledged progress, SUGA was thrilled, saying, &quot;As a regular program, a set was created  The first guest is Shin Dong Yeop &quot; Shin Dong Yeop showed a strong friendship, saying, &quot;I came because I said &#39;Suchwita&#39;  These days, there are shootings every day  But when SUGA calls, I have to come &quot;

He talked with Shin Dong Yeop and confessed his concerns  Referring to the fact that he worked outside, SUGA said, &ldquo;If the song goes well, it&rsquo;s my issue  If it doesn&rsquo;t work, it&rsquo;s my fault &quot; he said  Also, &quot;Actually, there was no one I could call a senior  There wasn&#39;t really anyone I could ask questions about  I&#39;ve been at the top for 31 years  I still think about &#39;Should I continue this?&#39; for 10 years  I am 30 years old  How can I get this far?&rdquo; SUGA also said, &quot;We also thought about our strengths and weaknesses a lot  The peak of a singer&#39;s prime is not long  That&#39;s why I always worry a lot  I worked hard and that&#39;s how it was  This time I&#39;m living thankfully  When this is over, I worry a lot about what to do  &quot;I don&#39;t think more people will listen to my music as time goes on  Being greedy for more than that is greed  Someone will listen to it  I think it should go that way,&quot; he said honestly &nbsp;

Jin&rsquo;s military service:

On December 13th of last month, Jin entered the 5th Infantry Division Recruit Training Center in Yeoncheon, Gyeonggi-do and began his military service  Jin&#39;s enlistment was the first among BTS members  On October 17 of last year, BIGHIT MUSIC said, &quot;We inform you that BTS has started detailed preparations to fulfill their military service obligations &quot;

Jin also revealed his plans and thoughts while thinking of enlisting in the first place through fan communities, etc  &ldquo;Here and there people said, &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it right not to go?&rsquo; or &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it right to go? There is no sense of injustice, and although it is regrettable, it is fortunate that the fans do not see the performance of tears &rdquo; Ahead of his enlistment, Jin revealed his short-cut hair, realizing the brief breakup, and began his military duty by enlisting in the boot camp amid the members&#39; send-off 

It was always a hot topic to see him undergoing basic military training for five weeks  In the image of Jin wearing a beret and military uniform and sitting with his classmates at the training center to take pictures, we could see his appearance as &#39;Soldier Kim Seok Jin&#39; rather than &#39;BTS Jin&#39;  Due to his exemplary military life, Jin was appointed as a company commander trainee and led his classmates  Jin participated in each training with the motivation of trainees who were not members of &#39;BTS&#39;  From shooting training to CBRN training, especially in CBRN training, the image of the classmates washing their faces in the pouring water attracted attention  Jin successfully received his basic military training by completing a 20km tactical march 

Plans for military training:

After completing his basic military training, Jin is known to continue the rest of his military life as an assistant instructor in the training center for new recruits  According to a media report on the 13th, Jin will serve as an assistant in the 5th Division Recruit Training Center, where he received basic military training  Jin will complete his recruit training on the 18th and will serve as an assistant instructor in the same battalion from January 19th  In this regard, Big Hit Music, the agency of BTS, said, &ldquo;It is difficult to confirm &rdquo; Meanwhile, other members of BTS will also perform their military service sequentially according to their own plans  Jin&#39;s expected discharge date is June 12, 2024

Shin Dong Yeop, who celebrated his 31st year of debut this year  Suga said, &quot;Actually, I haven&#39;t had anyone who could be called a senior since my debut &quot; I still think about it  I wonder how you did for 31 years &rdquo; Then Shin Dong Yeop said, &quot;Since I was young, I have been loved and recognized, and I have earned money compared to my age  At one point, I took it for granted  I lost my gratitude and my original intentions  I can&#39;t even think of losing my original intentions &quot;&nbsp;

In addition, Shin Dong Yeop said, &quot;What I do best, even if I look at my strengths, I can work more happily without getting hurt  This is the broadcast I have been doing  Even if I work every day now, I don&#39;t feel stressed at all  I am so happy and happy when I work &quot; I&#39;ve never thought about the number of years, but since I realized that, I&#39;m really happy and mentally healthy &quot; On the other hand, SUGA sympathized, saying, &quot;We also thought about that a lot,&quot; and laughed, saying, &quot;Actually, the peak of singers&#39; peak wasn&#39;t long  We worked hard  But these days, we&#39;re working with gratitude in our hearts &quot; Suga also said, &quot;I don&#39;t think more people will listen to my music as time goes by  Being greedy for more than that is greed  Someone will listen to it  I think that&#39;s how it should go,&quot; he said honestly 

Suchwita Episode 1:&nbsp;

The first episode of SUGA&rsquo;s own talk show &#39;Suchwita&#39; was released on BTS&#39; official channel  &#39;Suchwita&#39; is a talk show where SUGA meets people from various fields through alcohol and music and shares honest stories  On this day, RM appeared as the first guest  The two had a deep talk with traditional liquor  SUGA tilted his glass, saying, &quot;Originally, RM wasn&#39;t the type to drink often  When I was young, when I came in after drinking, he was a very pitiful member  Lately, he&#39;s been drinking a little &quot; Recently, RM released his first official solo album &#39;Indigo&#39;  RM said, &quot;It feels a little strange  It&#39;s been exactly 15 years since I started music, and finally a work that can be officially recognized has come out  There were regrets or regrets about half of &#39;Mono &#39;, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case with this one  I&#39;m happy &quot;

While RM and SUGA looked back on the difficult pandemic period, they also foresaw the future activities of BTS  SUGA confessed that he remembers February 25, 2020, &quot;It was a shocking day for me  I saw my schedule canceled in front of my eyes in real time  With the pandemic coming, the tour was canceled, and I felt very helpless &quot; RM also looked back at the time of the tour cancellation and recalled, &quot;I didn&#39;t believe it then  It was a stage of denial  Later, I threw a pillow in reaction &quot;

BTS&rsquo; military enlistment:

BTS plans to enlist sequentially, starting with Jin, the eldest, to fulfill their military duty  Previously, the agency Big Hit Music said, &quot;We hope to resume activities as a complete group of BTS in about 2025, but it is difficult to specify the exact time at this point &quot; RM said, &quot;In 2025, it will be right after I&#39;m discharged &quot; &quot;If I return to society quickly, shouldn&#39;t the members do some work before returning or prepare something for me?&quot;

In response, SUGA said, &quot;One of the hardest things since I was young was being afraid of the future &quot; The point in time was 2020  So I can&#39;t say, &#39;I&#39;m going to do something in 2025&#39;&quot;, taking a cautious stance  RM said, &ldquo;It would be nice if we could all gather together and promote as a whole in 2025 as we wish &rdquo;

He has a ruffled collar shirt as well. The eyebrow piercing is also being noticed by the ARMY. All in all, Jungkook is giving out the vibes of some novella.

Folio usually consists of a collection of drawings, documents, etc. that represent a person's, especially an artist's, work and it seems Jungkook has been the editor for the image as well.

Is actor Kim Taehyung returning? Fans wonder after BTS’ V revealed as 4th most popular Korean celeb on IMDb,"BTS member V, who is also known by his real name Kim Taehyung, has been a globally loved superstar  Being one of the BTS members has obviously earned him the due fame that he has worked hard for ever since his debut in 2013, however, his &lsquo;social butterfly&rsquo; self and unbounded charisma has let him explore different opportunities  One of these was his K-drama acting debut with &lsquo;Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth&rsquo;  Since then, V has not taken up any acting projects and has continued to promote with BTS as it grew humongous on a global scale and dipped into little solo work, including the creation of his solo album which is expected to be released sometime soon  However, the demand for his return continues, maybe growing bigger with time as fans root for more &lsquo;actor V&rsquo; 

BTS&rsquo; V in Hwarang

V was the first from BTS to delve into K-drama acting after his debut and did so with KBS2&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth&rsquo;  Alongside the leads of Park Seo Joon, Park Hyung Sik, Go Ara and a cast full of popular actors like Choi Min Ho, Seo Yea Ji, V became the maknae everyone adored  In the character of Seok Han Sung, he was the youngest as also in real life, adding to the fun 

While the show ended with V&rsquo;s character (SPOILER ALERT) Han Sung&rsquo;s dramatic death, it was a scene that will be remembered in the BTS fandom for a long time  A lot of praise went to the K-pop star as it was his first attempt at acting in a K-drama, seemingly seeing a lot of effort and emotion in action  As one of the Hwarang men, he trained endlessly and carried a jolly attitude becoming a favourite of everyone  Everyone talked about his relationship with Park Seo Joon&rsquo;s character&nbsp;as they expressed camaraderie beyond on-screen presence  V became best friends with actors Park Seo Joon and Park Hyung Sik after the filming was done and they came together with actor Choi Woo Shik and musician Peakboy to form the Wooga Squad  On the other hand, his on-screen friendship Go Ara&rsquo;s character was also a fan favourite 

Most popular Korean celebrities on IMDb

While the list was recently made public, what caught the netizens&rsquo; attention was spotting BTS&rsquo; V on it at a very high position  Essentially, a ranking of sorts gauging people&rsquo;s interest in Korean celebrities related to films, it was unexpected to spot the name of Kim Taehyung in it as he has never previously acted in a movie  While BTS themselves have released various cinematic collections of their concerts and their journey in the music world, none were ones that had them showcase their acting to the audience &nbsp;

First on the list is Park Chan Wook, the director behind mindblowing creations like &lsquo;The Handmaiden&rsquo;, &lsquo;Oldboy&rsquo;, &lsquo;Thirst&rsquo; and more recently, &lsquo;Decision to Leave&rsquo;  One of the most prominent personalities in the world of Korean film, he has upheld his name for quite a long time now  His depth in terms of understanding various dark stories and bringing them to life has been appreciated by critics globally  Leading the list is a very obvious pick for the 59 year old whose work people always look forward to 

Following closely behind is director Bong Joon Ho who has become a pioneer in the movie industry thanks to his contribution to internationally acclaimed projects like &lsquo;Memories of Murder&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Host&rsquo;, &lsquo;Snowpiercer&rsquo;, &lsquo;Okja&rsquo; and &lsquo;Parasite&rsquo;  The last one earned a Palme d&#39;Or and 3 Academy Awards making quite the roar across the film fraternity  Known for his black humour and socially unique topics, he occupies the rightful second place on the list 

Steven Yeun grabs the third position owing to his notable roles in films like &lsquo;Okja&rsquo; and &lsquo;Burning&rsquo; as well as the TV show, &lsquo;The Walking Dead&rsquo;  He established himself with varied roles that allowed him to be considered for unique characters  His nomination as the first Asian-American actor at the Screen Actors Guild for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role has been immensely written about 

V takes fourth place on the popularity list thanks to his acting in &lsquo;Hwarang&rsquo; as well as the online presence he has built so far with his elegant, relatable and all-giving nature  Multiple international directions have previously expressed their interest to cast him  While he is yet to sign any films, fans are definitely looking forward to actor Kim Taehyung making a return to their screens sooner rather than later

NewJeans surpasses BTS to gain THIS title on Spotify Korea; Joins BIGBANG and 2NE1 on Melon Chart,"On January 17, NewJeans&rsquo; Hype Boy became the most streamed song in Spotify Korea with 5 899 Million streams, beating BTS&rsquo; Butter which currently has 5 895 million streams  This battle between HYBE Label artists is amazing, seeing how NewJeans was able to achieve this feat just 6 months after their debut!&nbsp;
https://twitter com/NewJeansCharts/status/1615004915163701252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1615004915163701252%7Ctwgr%5Ed9f4e96852b6a67daeb755d33b686ece07770a02%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww allkpop com%2Farticle%2F2023%2F01%2Fnewjeans-hype-boy-surpasses-btss-butter-to-become-the-most-streamed-song-on-spotify-in-koreaNewJeans on Melon Weekly Charts:

NewJeans also joins BIGBANG and 2NE1 as the third idol group and sixth artist in Melon history to simultaneously occupy all three top spots of Melon&rsquo;s Weekly Charts after Ditto, OMG and Hype Boy took up the top spots  It also makes the first group to achieve this feat in 8 years! Previously, only BIGBANG and 2NE1 were able to do so, once again showing NewJeans&rsquo; popularity &nbsp;

Based on the Melon TOP100 chart on January 17th, NewJeans&#39; &#39;Ditto&#39; is number one  After its release on December 19 last year, it drew attention as it maintains the top spot in competition with the songs of prominent artists  It is also noteworthy that the unchanging top charts, including &#39;Ditto&#39;  Younha&#39;s &#39;Event Horizon&#39; and BIGBANG&#39;s&nbsp;Taeyang&#39;s &#39;VIBE&#39; (Feat  BTS&#39; Jimin) were ranked 4th and 5th, respectively 

NewJeans on Billboard Charts:&nbsp;

Lee Hwa Jeong, a researcher at NH Investment &amp; Securities, said that NewJeans is expected to enter the Billboard main single chart Hot 100 with the new song &#39;Ditto&#39; and It is a achievement after half a year of debut, and it is not a sparkling effect right after the album release  It deserves special attention  Unlike the album chart (Billboard 200), where K-pop artists frequently appear, in the case of the single chart (Hot 100), publicity indicators such as streaming, sales, and radio airplay for each song must be supported to enter  It is relatively difficult, he emphasized  For reference, considering that the starting point for BLACKPINK&rsquo;s public awareness in the US was when &#39;DDU-DU DDU-DU&#39; entered the Hot 100 in 2018, it is particularly worth paying attention to &nbsp;

NewJeans&rsquo; Ditto:&nbsp;

The &#39;monster rookie&#39; NewJeans, who entered their 5th month of debut, are doing an overwhelming job  In addition to the long-term box office success of their debut songs, they are building new records by succeeding in consecutive box office hits with two of their recently released singles  NewJeans released their first single album &#39;OMG&#39; on the 2nd  This album, which contains the title song &#39;OMG&#39; and &#39;Ditto&#39;, which was released in advance last month, talks about a relationship once again in a slightly strange distance and a little unfamiliar background, showing New Jeans&#39; unique winter sensibility 

Immediately after its release, &lsquo;Ditto&rsquo; landed at No  1 on the real-time charts of Melon, Bugs, and Genie on domestic music sites, and also entered the Melon Weekly Chart at No  1  Following this, &lsquo;Ditto&rsquo; has been holding the No  1 spot on the weekly chart for three consecutive weeks  On the Spotify &#39;Daily Top Song Global&#39; chart, it ranked 19th with 3 26 million daily streams (as of December 20)  Following BTS and BLACKPINK, NewJeans is the only group with more than 3 million global daily streams 

In particular, according to the US Billboard, NewJeans&#39; &#39;Ditto&#39; ranked 4th on the Billboard &#39;Global (excluding the US)&#39; and 8th on the &#39;Global 200&#39; on the chart dated the 14th  This is NewJeans&#39; own highest ranking record, and New Jeans became an artist who entered the top 10 of the &#39;Global 200&#39; and the top 5 of the &#39;Global (excluding the US)&#39; in the shortest period as a K-pop group &nbsp;

OMG:&nbsp;

&#39;OMG&#39;, which was released following &#39;Ditto&#39;, which reached No  1, also quickly swept the top of the charts and succeeded as a box office success  It ranked first on the real-time music charts in Korea, and ranked second on the daily chart after &#39;Dito&#39;  It continued to receive enthusiastic responses abroad  It settled at 25th place on the Spotify &#39;Daily Top Song Global&#39; chart (as of the 6th) and 95th place on the &#39;Weekly Top Song Global&#39; chart (first week of January) 

The album sales also increased significantly compared to the previous work  According to Hanteo Chart, an album sales statistics site on the 8th, &#39;OMG&#39; sold a total of 701,241 copies during the week of its release  On the second day of release, it recorded cumulative sales of 580,000 copies and achieved a half-million seller (500,000 copies)  NewJeans, who set a new record (310,000 copies) in the first week of a girl group debut album release with their previous album &#39;NewJeans&#39;, sold more than twice the record at that time with &#39;OMG&#39; 

About NewJeans:

NewJeans, which debuted at the end of July last year, created a syndrome with title songs such as &#39;Attention&#39; and &#39;Hype Boy&#39; from their first mini-album &#39;NewJeans&#39;  At the time, &#39;Attention&#39; recorded the highest score on the real-time, daily, weekly, and monthly charts of domestic music sites such as Melon, Genie, Flo, Bugs, and Vibe  1 on the Circle Digital Chart for the month of August  &#39;Hype Boy&#39; followed that, dominating the music charts by ranking 2nd and 3rd  It also entered the US Spotify weekly chart as the first debut song by a K-pop group

aespa, who ranked 3rd on the Billboard 200 main album chart in the US, is appearing at various local festivals  In April 2022, they successfully completed their first live stage in the country through the largest outdoor music festival in the US, &#39;Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival&#39;  In addition, they became the first K-pop girl group to appear in the outdoor concert &#39;GMA 2022 Summer Concert Series 2022&#39; hosted by ABC&#39;s representative morning show &#39;Good Morning America&#39; (GMA) every summer &nbsp;&nbsp;

aespa also participated in a branding campaign with the message of &#39;sustainable travel&#39; in celebration of the New Year  Following Stray Kids and Lee Jun-ho, on the 27th, the third episode of the &#39;LDF Original Series&#39; was released for the first time, aespa&rsquo;s edition is a short drama titled &lsquo;Melody of the Stars&#39;, and contains a total of 3 episodes of aespa&#39;s sustainable travel story  It is a story about aespa members sympathizing with the preciousness of the earth while going on a stargazing trip to Australia  The title of this short drama, &lsquo;Melody of the Stars&#39;, was taken from the title of the song &lsquo;Melody of the Stars&#39;, which was used as the background music along with the beautiful shooting star video in the drama  &lsquo;Melody of the Stars&#39; expresses the color and brightness of stars with sound &nbsp;

About aespa:&nbsp;

In the last episode, which will be released on January 9th, aespa members deliver messages about &#39;sustainable travel&#39; and &#39;protecting the earth&#39; in four languages, respectively Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese  Behind the growth of K-POP as an industry, there was a system of domestic entertainment companies that systematized the process from artist development to performance planning and marketing  However, it was not an achievement achieved only by the power of the system  The rapid growth of K-POP in recent years is because there were attractive artists who could satisfy hundreds of millions of global fandoms around the world 

Unfortunately, the period from 2020 to 2022, the period of the global COVID-19 pandemic, was a time when many next-generation talented K-pop groups appeared  During this period, groups that stood out and were loved by fandoms around the world were especially female groups  SM Entertainment&#39;s &#39;aespa&#39;, which introduced the metaverse worldview storytelling called &#39;Wilderness&#39; and the &#39;Hyper POP&#39; genre, which twisted the grammar of existing pop music, into the album, marked the beginning of the next generation of K-POP  It was an informed group  aespa, which debuted in November 2020, was evaluated as &ldquo;unique&rdquo; by conveying a different feeling from typical SM style groups by putting the &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo; of the metaverse worldview as one concept  In addition, with each member&#39;s overwhelming visuals and corresponding singing and performance skills, aespa almost monopolized the popularity of the K-POP industry in 2021 with popular songs such as &lsquo;Next Level&rsquo; and &lsquo;Savage&rsquo; 

aespa&#39;s uniqueness received favorable reviews from unexpected media  &lsquo;Forbes&rsquo;, an American economic media, reported that aespa&#39;s first mini-album &lsquo;Savage&rsquo; ranked Billboard&#39;s &#39;Top Album Sales&#39; ranking of the 100 best-selling albums in the United States &rsquo; Regarding their second place on the chart, they praised, &ldquo;This 4-member group&rsquo;s first album is a very important and tremendous victory compared to the records of all female singers in Korea &rdquo;

aespa&rsquo;s Synk Road:&nbsp;

The group aespa foreshadowed a variety of charms with its first solo reality show  As it is the first trip among the members, all four members are excited and excited, saying that they showed high tension  In the car leaving for Gangwon-do, Super Junior&#39;s Shindong, a &#39;entertainment senior&#39;, made a surprise appearance on the VCR and generously introduced &#39;reality essential car games&#39; to the aespa members, such as high-pitched battles, holding back laughter games, and song endings, and passed on the know-hows of the trip 

The members who returned after carrying out thrilling activity missions in the beautiful nature of Gangwon-do brought laughter with cute reactions, saying, &ldquo;We are back alive!&rdquo; and &ldquo;We will live kindly &rdquo; The question is amplified whether aespa succeeded in the mission and obtained the first ae-key safely

"Jimin signs with Dior, SUGA is Valentino’s Di.Va, J-Hope to stick to LV? BTS members’ brand ambassador roundup","The BTS members have everything going for them- the music, the fans, the visuals, the vocals, and now even the brands  The South Korean icons&rsquo; global influence has seen no bounds in recent years  From taking over international venues with thousands in the audience to doing a free concert in their home ground, the group has flaunted its massive presence, and rightly so  With such an impact, brand deals are bound to come knocking on their doors without hesitation  While earlier the seven would sign all contracts together, their June 2022 announcement where they revealed plans of also focusing on solo endeavors were revealed, opened more doors for the members 

BTS&rsquo; journey with Louis Vuitton

In 2019, the South Korean group first worked with the fashion house for their outfits while doing album promotions  However, 2021 marked the group&rsquo;s official start with the label as they were roped as in the global brand ambassadors  The septet also rocked then-Artistic Director Virgil Abloh&rsquo;s Men&#39;s Fall-Winter 2021 collection  It is being said that the contract between the fashion house and the group is now up after 2 years of successful collaborations 

Jimin with Dior

On January 16, BTS member Jimin was announced as the official global brand ambassador for the French luxury fashion house  Reports point out that he is officially the 18th current ambassador for the brand and the 1st Asian male celeb to be named so  This deal follows the group&rsquo;s long-running history with the brand as Dior had designed the members&rsquo; stage outfits for their &lsquo;Love Youself: Speak Yourself&rsquo; world tour back in 2019  Jimin&rsquo;s oomph in carrying his outfits makes him a perfect fit for the brand 

SUGA with Valentino

Known as the rapper of the group, member SUGA of BTS is so much more  From providing his meaningful insights to his chart-topping productions, he has been leading the group&rsquo;s success in multiple ways alongside the other six  Following his recent visit to Los Angeles where a special collaboration between him and the Italian luxury fashion house was announced, on January 17 he was officially declared as the brand&rsquo;s newest brand ambassador  He will join the group of people known as Di Vas, an acronym for Different Values that they hope to endorse with their products  The BTS member will be helming the Maison Valentino Essentials campaign with which he aims to propagate his shared values of diversity alongside the brand 

Will J-Hope continue with Louis Vuitton?

On the same day, Louis Vuitton announced that J-Hope will be heading to the 2023 Paris Fashion Week to attend the brand&rsquo;s Men&#39;s Fall-Winter 2023 Fashion Show on January 19  The BTS member has previously teased his possible partnership with the brand through Instagram stories shared on his account in the past week  It also seems that a new solo fashion project with the &lsquo;Jack In The Box&rsquo; singer is in the work and will likely take his own famed style quotient into consideration 

Member Jimin is also expected to join J-Hope on his visit to the Paris Fashion Week for his own promotions ahead of the former&rsquo;s upcoming solo debut  Apart from these, there have been no confirmed signed deals with any brands for the rest of the members  Here&rsquo;s what we can expect in the coming days 

RM for Bottega Veneta

A probable plan for signing the BTS leader could be in the works for the Italian brand which was seen throughout RM&rsquo;s &lsquo;Indigo&rsquo; promotions  While it is possible that Kim Namjoon chose his outfits based on his own preferences rather than a fashion deal, fans are hoping that the smart styling becomes the right fit for him  To add to their beliefs they&rsquo;ve found out that Matthieu Blazy, the creative director, and Dario Gargiulo, the chief marketing and digital business officer of Bottega Veneta started following the BTS member recently 

V for Celine

It is more likely than not that the BTS member signs with the French luxury brand following his solo gig alongside BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Lisa and Park Bo Gum last year which went viral for all the right reasons  V is known to harbour a special liking for the brand and can easily carry their confident fits with flair  Fans are also hoping that he signs with Gucci which has a more fancy style, going perfectly well with the K-pop star 

Jungkook for Versace

The youngest from the group was spotted in a fabulous fit from the brand for his performance at the 2022 FIFA World Cup Opening Ceremony  It went well with the expensive but pleasing look that the BTS member is known to admire  They also have edgier options for when Jungkook wishes to do different and following the group&rsquo;s meeting with Donatella Versace at the 64th GRAMMY Awards, it seems more than likely 

Jin for Cartier

While the oldest member is currently serving in the military and will not sign anything until he&rsquo;s back, fans are rooting for Jin&nbsp;to land a deal with Cartier with whom they think he would be the best fit &nbsp;

Member SUGA has always been a sought-after producer and featuring artist and this year was no different  He spread his magic throughout with chart-topping releases and making massively talked about appearances  In fact, just like the other members, he got to do what he has probably been wanting for a long time as he began his own drinking talk show &nbsp;

Suchwita
Named after SUGA&rsquo;s uber-famous title track &lsquo;Daechwita&rsquo; off of his second solo mixtape, &lsquo;D-2&rsquo;, the show was revealed as &lsquo;Suchwita&rsquo;, a result of the combination between his name and the song  The aim of the show?

JQGBaXgyTQ4While this year has treated SUGA in a favourable way, we take a look at the 3 moments that take the crown 

That That

Basketball visit

                                                                                    
                                                                                SUGA is known to be a fan of basketball and is even good at playing it, the fans must be aware  He has expressed the same multiple times, and this year happened to bring another fabulous opportunity to him  The South Korean superstar visited Japan to meet up with the team of Golden State Warriors, one of SUGA&rsquo;s favourites  He came across Stephen Curry, and the two chatted about being each other&rsquo;s fans briefly before snapping some photos and signing mementoes for each other  Moreover, SUGA greeted tennis player Naomi Osaka who is known to be a BTS fan  His visit to Japan became a hot topic as fans of both, the Dub Nation as well as the BTS ARMY, celebrated the crossover 

Haircut

Only SUGA knows
