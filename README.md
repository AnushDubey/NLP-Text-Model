This project involves the creation of an NLP pipeline for news content that involves removing unnecessary and redundant sentences from the news content. The pipeline uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which is a commonly used numerical statistic in NLP and information retrieval, to identify the most important sentences within a document.

The dataset used for this project can be found at this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KsWWrhGaK0_IMXPaYBOEXXE8IExqogmJ/edit). The project involves leveraging various techniques such as TF-IDF, Vectorization, Stemming, Lemmatization, Cosine Similarity etc. for similarity computation and cleaned text generation. 

The project uses a test-train split of 10-90 to generate cleaned responses for the test set. A table with columns for Original Content, New Content, Removed Lines, and Further Metrics is included for the test set.

## Methodology
The methodology folowed in the code is as follows:-
* **Dataset Reading**: The news.csv dataset is read into a pandas dataframe using the read_csv function.

* **Data Cleaning**: Any rows with empty content are dropped and duplicate entries are removed from the dataset. The index of the dataframe is reset.

* **Data Preprocessing**: The content column of the dataframe is preprocessed to remove special characters, digits, extra whitespace, stop words, and to perform stemming and lemmatization. The preprocessed content is stored in a new column named 'cleaned_content'.

* **Training and Testing Data Split**: The preprocessed dataset is split into training and testing datasets with a 90-10 split ratio ( 90 % train data, 10 % test data) using train_test_split function from sklearn.

* **Vectorization using TF-IDF**: The cleaned content of the training dataset is vectorized using the fit_transform() method of TfidfVectorizer using sklearn.

* **Ranking of Sentences in Test Data using TF-IDF scores**: For each news article in the training dataset, the sentences are ranked based on their TF-IDF scores using the non-zero feature indices from the corresponding row of the train_tfidf matrix. The top 5 sentences for each article are stored in a dictionary named train_tfidf_ranked_indices.
* **Train Data Summary**: The summary of most important sentences from each news article of train data is generated based on their TF-IDF scores

* **Content Generation in Test Data**: New content in test data is generated by removing insignificant words, using TF-IDF scores to get important words, and joining the top sentences.

* **BLEU Score Metric Calculation**: BLEU score for new content is calculated against original content using NLTK sentence_bleu.

* **Cosine Similarity Metric Calculation**: Cosine similarity between new content and original content is calculated using TF-IDF.

* **Result Dataframe**: Finally, result dataframe is created containing all the required fields- Original Content, New Content, Removed Lines, BLEU Score, and Cosine Similarity.

## About TFIDF and metrics (BLEU Score and Cosine Similarity)
* **TF-IDF** 

TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, which is a commonly used technique in natural language processing and information retrieval to quantify the importance of words in a document.
It works by calculating a weight for each term (word) in a document, which is a product of two measures: the term frequency (TF), which measures how frequently a term appears in a document, and the inverse document frequency (IDF), which measures how important a term is across all the documents in a corpus.
TF-IDF can be used to extract important features from text data, such as keywords or phrases, and can be used for various tasks such as document classification, search engine ranking, and text summarization.

* **BLEU Score** 

The BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score is a metric used in natural language processing to evaluate the quality of machine-generated text against human-written text. It is based on a comparison of n-grams (groups of consecutive words) between the generated text and the reference text. The score ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher score indicating better similarity between the generated and reference text. BLEU score is important in NLP as it provides a quantitative measure of the quality of machine-generated text and helps in comparing and selecting the best-performing models.

* **Cosine Similarity**

Cosine similarity is a measure used to determine the similarity between two vectors in NLP. It calculates the cosine angle between the two vectors, where a value of 1 indicates the two vectors are identical, and 0 indicates they are completely dissimilar. Cosine similarity is important in NLP as it helps to measure how similar two pieces of text are, which can be useful for various tasks such as text classification, information retrieval, and clustering. It is also commonly used in recommendation systems to find similar items based on user preferences or behavior.

The K-pop recently joined Pharrell Williams for a conversation and gave a special advice to all K-pop trainees During the interaction, RM had a few things to say when Pharrell mentioned that boy groups in American don't seem to be much respected despite coming up with quality content. He first cautioned about being a part of the same industry before saying that there is always some good and some bad things He admitted to starting his career as a rapper but coincidentally being into the centre of this system. He lauded HYBE Labels and its founder Bang PD, saying that they understood the artists since they are themselves heavily involved in the artistry. He added that being reminded of being a human keeps them grounded through everything RM then went on to give a special advice to the trainees in the industry, "Please donâ€™t forget you are human, you have a job in this industry and please be who you are and the fact that what we can do can influence the people, can charge each otherâ€™s batteries, you know, give, take love back and forth. Thatâ€™s what I think has always been important for me." A few months ago, BTS had announced that they are going separate ways to pursue solo careers, however, they pledged to return someday.
